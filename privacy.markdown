## 1. Who operates this website?

This website (**the Website**) is operated by StyleMania Limited, a company registered in England and Wales under registration number 7063626 whose registered office is at StyleMania Ltd, 10th Floor, 20 Eastbourne Terrace, London, W2 6LG, UK, trading as “Dressipi” (**we**, **us** or **Dressipi**).

## 2. What is this policy about?

Dressipi is committed to protecting your personal information when you use the Website and we want our users to have a safe and enjoyable experience. It is completely optional to become a registered user (a Member), and when you choose to do so, you will need to create your Dressipi Fashion Fingerprint® (fashion profiler) and enter certain personal data about yourself. To become a Member you will be required to set up an account with password, email address and your gender.  You may also wish to add your body shape information, clothes sizes, your colouring, age and other fashion preferences.  This policy explains what information we collect about you, and what we use it for, and also your rights in relation to that information.

## 3. What information will Dressipi collect about me?

### Unregistered Users

3.1 We encourage you to register with us in order to be part of the Dressipi community and to take full advantage of Dressipi's features detailed below. However, you may choose not to register and take advantage of any feature of our site where registration is not required.  If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our applications or hosting environments, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. It would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.

3.2 We also place small files known as 'cookies' (and/or similar technology) on your computer's hard drive to maintain the integrity of our content and to provide our users with a better site experience. Please see section 11 below for more information about  the cookies we place.

3.3 You do not always need to be a registered Member to participate in Dressipi competitions. When you sign up to participate in competitions which Dressipi may run from time to time on the Service, we will probably ask for personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth.

### Members

3.5 If you choose to register with us, we will collect personal information from you including your name, email address, gender, and password.  We may also give you the opportunity to add optional information about yourself.

3.6 You may also, be able to include optional information under the following categories: about you, your age, your interests and brand preferences, your body measurements, as well as contact information for other people that you provide to us. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you provide to us as part of using the Website (such as your likes and dislikes) or otherwise authorise us to collect.

3.7 We may store all or some of your personal information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit.  Please see section 11 below for more information about  the cookies we place.

### Retailer partners and hyperlinks

3.8 If you visit our site by 'clicking–through' from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the website from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information. Regardless of what information was transmitted to us, however, we don't keep it unless you register with us.

3.9 If you choose to purchase any clothing or accessories (or any other service Dressipi will or may provide) by clicking on a link provided on the Website to a retailer's website, that retailer will collect your personal details (such as your credit card number, address, etc.) for the purpose of completing your chosen transaction. We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with such retailers and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only information that we will collect with respect to such retailer links is: (a) the number of generic Dressipi users who use such links; (b) the number of purchases made by these generic users; and (c) your name, email address destination and selected product so that we may contact you to enquire about your experience or to propose compatible products (if you agree, see section 4 below).

3.10 The Website contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties including the retailers described above. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them.

We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

## 4. How will Dressipi use my information?
