## The numbers don't lie, and they're talking trends.

If ever there was a sign that the fashion industry as a collective is putting the focus on looking and moving forward it was the Haute Couture collections held in Paris this month.  In real life presentations showcasing creativity at its best to in real life Couture goers and front rowers. Whilst we won’t all be wearing the luxury of couture, our wardrobes have thankfully not been relegated to a stay-at-home groundhog day of not-so-elevated well-worn tees and comfy tracksuit pants. Fashion has held up a mirror to every socio-political-economic crisis throughout history, both during and after. 2020-2021 has been no different. So where have our post-pandemic hemlines and relegated-to-the-fashion-sidelines been heading post lockdown?

Thanks to the Diana effect (remember her Harvard sweatshirt and cycling shorts gym combo) discovered by a new generation of Tik-Tokers, and the dress-down glamour trend seen everywhere on the spring/summer catwalks from Celine to Prada and Gucci, you can hold onto and breathe new life into those beloved sweatshirts and tracksuit pants. Sales of sweatshirts tripled in volume compared to the same period in 2019 with a peak of 3.6% of total women’s spend mid lockdown. With a similar story for sweatpants. Coming out of lockdown this has been less about lounging about at home and more about the fact that spring/summer trends saw athleisure reworked into new ‘ways to wear’, from day to hybrid office/home working looks, to dressed-up for night. Sweatshirts have been cropped, mixed and matched, tie-dyed, embellished every which way; the opportunities are endless. Even pre-2020 the move towards athleisure by night - just add a disco diva heel and a sequin or two - was already taking shape over at the likes of Tom Ford.
