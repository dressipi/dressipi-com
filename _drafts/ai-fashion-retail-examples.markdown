Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is apparent across multiple sectors and has now started to play a crucial role in transforming the fashion industry. Although the basic retail experience hasn't changed much over the years from the standard Product Listing Page (PLP) > Product Display Page (PDP) journey, the use of AI in fashion is enabling retailers to make their businesses more efficient, improve the retail experience through personalization and automatically predict trends. AI has the potential to revolutionize fashion retail.

Research shows the size of [AI in the retail market](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-retail-market) exceeded USD 2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at more than 30% between 2021 and 2027. Make sure you’re up to date with this growing trend and discover some of the best fashion AI applications.

###How to use AI in fashion - applications in 2022

Fashion retailers at the forefront of innovation have already deployed AI across different areas of their business. Here are some of the current applications of AI in the fashion industry:

##1) *Improved customer personalization*: Retailers are still, showing the same products in the same order to all customers regardless of who they are, how frequently they shop or what page they land on.

Customers want a relevant and personalized experience and fashion AI will enable this by continually building an understanding of your customers and how they interact with your products at every step.

##2) [*Product forecasting*](https://dressipi.com/solutions/product-forecasting/): Most fashion retailers’ margin erosion is a result of the size and shape of how they buy their products. Fashion AI can help retailers move to demand-led predictions of size ratios for every product instead of relying on last year’s data. 

Fashion retailers often have to make decisions quickly, without having time to sift through all the data. However, using better fashion AI predictive retailing models can help them make better decisions, resulting in increased full-priced sell-through rates and decreased markdowns. In fact, modeling the true demand for a product can eliminate 25% of markdowns. 

AI data-driven retailing models can also help identify any net "overproduction," meaning when retailers are effectively buying markdowns from the outset. This can be easily eliminated with the added side benefit of improving the sustainability of the retailer and reducing waste. Another genuine Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) benefit for everyone.
