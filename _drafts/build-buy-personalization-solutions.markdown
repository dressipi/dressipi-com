### In a cost of living crisis how do retailers ensure that if you choose to spend your money, you spend it with them? 

Retailer analysts have long said that they need to have a [personalization solution](https://dressipi.com/solutions/product-discovery/) so the next question is buy vs build. They can’t sit back and do nothing.

There are 2 options:
1. 1. Use your existing data scientists  to build personalized recommendations in-house
2. 2. Leverage a third party solution such as Dressipi to deliver personalized recommendations

The obvious solution would be to simply build something from scratch with in-house teams asking each other ‘How hard could it be?’. Building personalized recommendations in-house will give you full control over the finished product and it might seem to offer cost savings. The reality is not so simple.

## What are the important factors?

There are many important factors that you need to consider when making this decision. Every case is unique but there are some simple questions you can ask yourself:

**Cost**: How much will it cost to build my own vs buying a third party solution?

**Time**: Customers are demanding personalized recommendations. What will allow me to deploy personalization faster? 

**Customizability**: The end solution needs to be one that meets all of my needs. Can I get this with a third party solution?

**Maintenance**: If I build in-house, how will I maintain a best in class product that can keep up with the competition?

**Workflow**: Is it easier to manage a solution provider or a team that is building personalized recommendations?

**Scalability & Performance**: Will building technology in-house provide better long term results?

We’ve dug deeper into the pros and cons of these factors to help you make the essential decision.
