## From tricky trends to spring/summer favourites, what trends your customers are buying into and how they’re wearing them is integral in how our Dressipi data helps to inspire merchandising each season. 

Bold brights, our favourite summer whites and perennial florals bring nothing new to the seasonal spring/summer palettes. But how to wear and ‘will you wear?’ top-to-toe colour, whether you highlight or not with accents of neon and where those on-trend cut-out details might be placed, do.

How much is too much? If the catwalks were anything to go by flesh baring cut-out details are not for the feint hearted. Saint Laurent spiced up bodycon lycra bodysuits with slashed out fabrics at the waist and bust; the whimsical Alberta Ferretti went all Grecian goddess with swathes of fabric draped to reveal toned tummies and tanned shoulders and Valentino gave structural cut-out waist detail dimensions to a punchy pink mini dress. But how much is too much especially when dresses are not reserved simply for evening bashes? This style inspiration has tended to be more user-friendly and toned down and consumers do seem to be partial to the catwalk inspired flashes of flesh for summer. Percentage of total dress revenue sees cut-out-at-waist detail dresses up from 0.59% May 2021 to 2.24% May 2022.

When it comes to dresses bold brights – from plain to prints - always a trusty summer wardrobe pick-me-up are seeing a steady rise, up from 16% total dress revenue in 2019 to 19% 2022 and as we head into summer holidays no doubt expected to rise. But bright colours this season are not just about the versatile joy of a throw-on-and-go dress. Separates and suiting - Dior and Prada - offer a bold alternative to the dress. And here it’s all in the way this trend is worn. Are your customers going down the top-to-colour-blocking route? Do they have a preference for a monotone take on the trend or do they favour bold clashing shades?
