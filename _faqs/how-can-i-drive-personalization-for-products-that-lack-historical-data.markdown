title: How can I drive personalization for products that lack historical data?
---
Dressipi's industry-leading product data ensures that no product is ever completely new. It has a set of product attributes that already has visit and sales propensities to learn from. This means our clients can start using new products in personalized recommendations from the get-go. This is especially important in fashion retail as sessions can be pretty short so we need to be able to make accurate predictions as early as possible, before the customer bounces.
