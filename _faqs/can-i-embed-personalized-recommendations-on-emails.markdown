Of course! Our API's can be delivered wherever the retailer desires. 

If you can speak to each customer at the right time, with as relevant a message as possible and a selection of products that really work for that customer then youâ€™ll start to reap the benefits. 

At Dressipi, we test our personalized emails against all other BAU and segmented emails and consistently outperform by significant margins, by up to 2-3x (revenue per email sent).
