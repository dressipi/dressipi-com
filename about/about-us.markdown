    body: |
      "We set up Dressipi to help the fashion industry change.
      Our mission is to transform how retailers engage with their customers through deeper, entirely personalised experiences; and use data to advance the buying and merchandising processes. 
      We believe this combination optimises demand and supply, giving retailers the profitability to invest in creating better products and services, and to tackle the issue of waste in the industry.
      We deliver genuine results, quickly and work with the world’s leading retailers.
