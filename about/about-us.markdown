          <p style="font-weight: bold;"> We set up Dressipi to help the fashion industry change. </p>
          Our mission is to transform how retailers engage with their customers through deeper, entirely personalised experiences; and use data to advance the buying and merchandising processes. <br/><br/>
          We believe this combination optimises demand and supply, giving retailers the profitability to invest in creating better products and services, and to tackle the issue of waste in the industry. <br/><br/>
          We deliver genuine results, quickly and work with the world’s leading retailers.
