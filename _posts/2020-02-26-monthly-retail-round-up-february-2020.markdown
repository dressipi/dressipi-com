# Monthly Retail Round-Up - February 2020

## At Dressipi we like to be right up to date with retail news. Here are the top stories this February.

### 1) Facial Recognition Trialling across London

Facial recognition is defined as *“the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face – captures, analyses, and compares biometric patterns based on a person’s facial details *([Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/facial-recognition-big-brother-or-ultimate-convenience/7039368.article?blocktitle=News-Analysis&contentID=21075)).” There are four main uses for it when it comes to retail including anti-shoplifting, automated check-out, customer service and customer journey tracking.

Facial recognition could be classed as creepy and invasive however reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/facial-recognition-tech-deployed-on-oxford-street/7039599.article) this February, *“the Metropolitan Police service has today launched live facial recognition technology at key locations in London’s Westminster, including Oxford Street and Regent Street.” *

This is despite the software being scrapped in 2018 in the Intu Trafford Centre in Manchester after the Surveillance Camera Commissioner stated that monitoring millions of innocent people was inappropriate, and again in September 2019 across London’s Kings Cross Central development (home to many retailers including Sweaty Betty, & Other Stories and Nike) because it involved tracking individuals without their consent.

Reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/facial-recognition-tech-deployed-on-oxford-street/7039599.article), *“Trials of the technology are also being used in locations including the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford and London’s West End.”*

Research by UK marketplace Onbuy.com, stated in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/facial-recognition-big-brother-or-ultimate-convenience/7039368.article?blocktitle=News-Analysis&contentID=21075) revealed:
* Only 32% of UK shoppers feel “relaxed” and “willing to use facial recognition” to pay for goods and services
* Just 17% of 5,000 respondents say they are comfortable about other people using facial recognition on them

### 2) London Fashion Week’s ‘Swap Shop’

With February comes fashion weeks across the world, including London. This time there was the launch of something new in the form of a ‘swap shop’.

As one of the many sustainability initiatives unveiled this fashion week, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/14/all-change-london-fashion-week-launches-first-ever-swap-shop) reported that *“Clothes swapping has become increasingly popular in recent years, as the appetite for dressing inexpensively and sustainably has boomed. But the practice has never before had such high-profile fashion industry approval.”*

The clothes swap attracted donations from industry heavyweights including the sustainable fashion campaigner Livia Firth and Sarah Mower, a critic and British Fashion Council (BFC) ambassador. Patrick McDowell, a young designer also made use of the clothes swap by creating a whole collection from it. He said, *“It’s an experiment. It’s never been done before. It fits in with the way the world’s moving, towards experiences, rather than consuming,” *

A well known fact in the retail industry also reported in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/14/all-change-london-fashion-week-launches-first-ever-swap-shop) by one of London Fashion Week’s organisers, Patrick Duffy, *“150bn items of clothing is made each year, so much is sent to landfill – 300,000 tonnes each year in Britain. And that is growing every year. We have to remember the environmental social impact of that.”* With this in mind, many other brands also put sustainable initiatives into motion:

* Mulberry has launched an initiative to collect and repurpose vintage handbags 
* Ashley Williams used fabric from past samples in her new collection
* Alexander McQueen announced a drive to donate its old, unused fabric to fashion students
