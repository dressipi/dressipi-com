# Matchesfashion - Expanding from Ecommerce to Bricks and Mortar

Luxury ecommerce has rapidly taken off over the past few years with platforms such as Farfetch reporting 74% growth in 2016 ([Fashionista](https://fashionista.com/2017/11/farfetch-revenue-sales-increase-2016)). However, it’s not just the luxury ecommerce market that is growing - all pure plays (including huge platforms such as ASOS and Amazon) are increasingly gaining market share, with [Retail Gazette](https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2018/08/is-clicks-to-bricks-the-new-brick-to-clicks/) reporting:

* Online sales now account for 17.4% of the UK’s total retail sales
* In June, online retail sales grew by 17%, which they have done for nearly every month since 2000

Despite this growth, [stores still play a huge role in the customer shopping journey](https://dressipi.com/blog/new-phase-of-retail-evolution-bricks-and-mortar-retailers/). Physical spaces are being occupied by pureplay retailers as a way to showcase their brand, establish a strong brand identity, and engage with their customers in a different way. [Boden opened a new store in January](https://dressipi.com/blog/from-clicks-to-bricks-bodens-new-flagship-store/) and even [Google ](http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Google_Sizes%20up_Physical_Retail_Store.php)is looking to open its first physical store in Chicago.

Not only do stores allow customers to try on products and allow for face to face style advice, they are also being increasingly introduced to enable immersive brand experiences and encourage the social aspect of shopping. Luxury fashion retailer Matchesfashion has taken this to the next level with 5 Carlos Place, creating a concept space which allows more than just shopping.

# Matchesfashion

5 Carlos Place is a retail, events and broadcasting space, connecting the physical and digital by bringing Matchesfashion’s online shopping and content into one space. Reported in [Vogue](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/the-future-of-retail-stores), Jess Christie, Chief Brand Officer, Matchesfashion announced *"We want to bring a sense of enjoyment back to physical retail and create a sense of community"*.

For the launch of 5 Carlos Place, Matchesfashion collaborated with Prada to create an installation with Prada marked vending machines, pinball machines and 100 products only available in the Matchesfashion store. This fun-filled shopping space spans over the first 2 floors of the beautiful red-bricked Marylebone building, with collaborations by new designers changing every few weeks, bringing a freshness and exclusivity to an exciting and ever evolving space.
