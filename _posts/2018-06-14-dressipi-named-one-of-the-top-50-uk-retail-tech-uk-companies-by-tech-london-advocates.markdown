Following hot on the heels of San Francisco and New York, London is a city brimming with tech talent. 

# Dressipi Named One Of The Top 50 UK Retail Tech UK Companies by Tech London Advocates

Venture capital investments into the UK’s tech sector reached all all-time high of £2.99bn in 2017, almost double the total invested in 2016 ([City A.M](http://www.cityam.com/278258/londons-tech-scene-pulls-record-gbp25bn-2017-venture)). With the tech sector employing 2.1m people across the UK ([City A.M](http://www.cityam.com/287551/new-startup-visas-bring-top-global-talent-londons-tech)), what better place to host Europe's largest festival of tech and innovation than the UK capital itself?

[London Tech Week](https://londontechweek.com/) brings together 55,000 attendees to enjoy hundreds of events taking place across the city, with the aim of showcasing the best and brightest tech around. A big contributor to the festival are [Tech London Advocates](http://www.techlondonadvocates.org.uk/), an unrivalled collection of tech leaders, experts and investors, hosting events that discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the city’s technology sector.

One of their events at London Tech Week was the launch of the [Retail Tech 50 Catalogue](http://www.techlondonadvocates.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RetailTech_Gatefold_Pages.pdf), showcasing the Top 50 UK Retail Tech businesses. Categories covered all areas from Payments, Data & Analytics, Supply Chain & Delivery, and In-Store Tech. Dressipi were delighted to be part of the Top 50 in the Ecom & Digital category, alongside many other brilliant businesses.

[The Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/tech-london-advocates-retail-tech-start-ups-uk-a3861591.html) covered the event, featuring Dressipi in their Top 8 and stating that retail isn’t just about e-commerce anymore. Eugene Fisher, TLA’s Retail Tech group lead highlighted, *“While ASOS and Farfetch represent some of London’s internationally acclaimed successes, this list highlights the brightest and best of our vibrant start-up ecosystem.” *

The evening was a great success, with some other businesses present that are working on [improving customer experience](https://dressipi.com/solutions/customer-experience/):

## MishiPay

Daniel Helman, VP Sales, described how [MishiPay](https://www.mishipay.com/home) benefits both customers and retailers by providing a seamless checkout experience where the customer scans the item, pays and then leaves without having to queue.

## Mercaux

Jonathan Horemans, Strategic Business Development, explained how [Mercaux](https://mercaux.com/) links online and in-store experiences. Through an app, employees can be given full product knowledge, take inventory checks, and give the customer outfits suggestions for a chosen garment.

## Poq

Balint Szeplaki, Head of Product at [Poq](https://poqcommerce.com/) outlined how they build apps across multiple devices for their clients including Missguided and House of Fraser.

There are a huge number of businesses innovating and breaking into the retail sector, and given our expertise in [retail personalisation](https://dressipi.com/retail-personalisation-case-study/), Dressipi was delighted to be considered one of the top UK companies switching up the fashion game. Thanks very much to Tech London Advocates for hosting a brilliant evening.
