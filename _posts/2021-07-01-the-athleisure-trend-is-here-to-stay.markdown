## Some interesting findings from our data analysts.

After a clear demand shift as people spent more time at home, the casualisation of fashion looks set to stay. Our data analysts examined the changes in product categories as a percentage of total spend in 2019, the same period in 2021 and what the percentage peaked at during the height of lockdown. 

With people turning to garments that were comfortable and multifunctional, categories such as sweatshirts, tracksuit bottoms and leggings led the charge with the biggest changes:

* **Sweatshirts** have tripled in volume of sales compared to the same period in 2019, from 0.5% of total womenswear spend in 2019 to 1.5% in the same period in 2021. They peaked at around 3.6% at the height of lockdown.

* **Tracksuit bottoms** have held a similar story. They were 4% of overall bottoms spend for this time in 2019 which has now increased to 12%, after ballooning to a whopping 34% at the height of lockdown.

* **Leggings** sales have doubled from 4% in 2019 to 8% for the same period in 2021 with a peak of 27%.
