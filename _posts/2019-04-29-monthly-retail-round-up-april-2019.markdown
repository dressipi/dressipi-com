# Monthly Retail Round-Up - April 2019

## Dressipi brings you April’s most exciting retail stories, all with a common thread of sustainability.

### 1) PrettyLittleThing Takes Steps Towards Sustainability

With sustainability being a hot topic among retailers, [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7035407.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRRM1lqWXlNalZpWkRBeiIsInQiOiJLemdaQk1nKzFwUlRGbEltY2tWTmZBYTQ4MjJMZGFNWnNTbERFZFp4dUhiMmRPMDdZZEZnbXBVQUJVSzRlTGZTY3BFMXRQNkdpY0c1ajJWTWlZZlhweWlmWEdqVTZJaDJ4akg0VkVHelZSa2J5R0ZVY0NQcEhsMFltbmkrSkdQMSJ9) reported that *“PrettyLittleThing has partnered with clothing-recycling app Regain in an effort to divert consumers’ unwanted garments from landfill.”* [Regain] (https://regain-app.com/)encourages customers to donate their unwanted clothes and in return will give discount codes for them to use towards their next PrettyLittleThing purchase.

Reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/prettylittlething-teams-up-with-recycling-app-regain/2019041842739), *“Online fast fashion brands like PrettyLittleThing, Missguided, ASOS and Boohoo are often criticized for being unsustainable. Now it seems like PrettyLittleThing, one of the brands under the Boohoo Group, is looking to diminish its environmental impact - or at least change its reputation.”*

[Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7035470.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRZeFpUVTRPV0U0WWpFMCIsInQiOiJCTWdPdzZSdFl2dzVoc3ppZmZQbCtcL1BWNUpyT0NvOWRKSk1FMnJMelY4NnY3Uit3MnhYZnc5Z0prdGZLUStRMVJiYytSOStyZXN1Y0pyMnJxcWJuQ0lEOVVZYnluVldnNWZuRUtjSWh0T1NiTWFNdFh4Qm9yUDJEOUxJTmh2MG8ifQ%3D%3D) also reported, in another bid to become more sustainable, PrettyLittleThing *“has launched a collection made from recycled materials and fabrics.”*

Umar Kamani, CEO, PrettyLittleThing said, *“This is another step in the right direction towards sustainable fashion. We know this isn’t the answer to everything, and our aim is to continue to learn new ways and adapt new methods in which the business as a whole can become more sustainable and responsible in terms of protecting the planet for the future.”*

### 2) A New Way to Receive Fashion Advice

Reported in the [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/hm-itsapark-styling-platform-fashion-advice-forum-a4109436.html), H&M has *“launched a platform (website and Instagram account) called ‘[Itsapark](https://www.itsapark.com/welcome)’ which facilitates peer-to-peer styling and shopping recommendations”* in an attempt *“to engage the millennial ecommerce customer”.*

People can ask questions such as ‘What should I wear on a first date?’, ‘How do I dress for an important interview?’, and ‘How can I make beige look cool?’. These questions must be posted on the ‘Discussion’ page for Itsapark to assign three ‘creators’ who are rewarded to answer it.
