### 1) Harvey Nichols to Holly Nichols

Knightsbridge department store, Harvey Nichols rebranded to Holly Nichols for its September campaign ‘Let’s hear it for the Girls’. Reported in [WWD](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/harvey-nichols-renamed-holly-nichols-1202782361/), *“The launch comes shortly after the reopening of the store’s designer women’s wear floor earlier this year”*.

### 2) New Names and New Identities

Two other retailers that have rebranded but with more permanent changes this September are:

**John Lewis**

Reported in [The Retail Bulletin](https://www.theretailbulletin.com/news/john-lewis-and-waitrose-unveil-new-brand-names-04-09-18/), John Lewis and Waitrose unveiled new brand names. They have added ‘& Partners’ to their names *“to highlight the company’s Partnership business model and culture as it looks to differentiate itself from its main competitors”.*

The new names can now be seen across all the facades of their flagship stores and will continue to be added to stores over the next few years. As stated by [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/john-lewis-adds-partners-as-part-of-rebrand/2018090438644), *“all logos have been changed on both retailer’s websites, as well as carrier bags, uniforms, trolleys, marketing activity, internal shop signs and selected lorries and vans”*. 

**Debenhams**

Another Department store that rebranded this month was Debenhams. Reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/debenhams-launches-new-brand-identity/2018090438649), as part of their new modernisation scheme ‘Debenhams Redesigned’, they have unveiled a *“modern, friendlier brand identity as part of continued transformation”*. This is their first rebrand in 20 years and spans across its social and digital platforms as well as their stores. The rebrand includes a new logo, store modernisation, a revamped website and a new flagship store in Watford.

In an overall strategy to get customers back into their stores, Sergio Bucher, CEO, Debenhams said in a statement (reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/debenhams-launches-new-brand-identity/2018090438649)) *“The Debenhams Redesigned strategy sets out to reinvent the shopping experience for customers. Whilst we have made real improvements to our stores and continue to improve our product offering we also want to signify overtly to customers that Debenhams is changing and give them more reasons to come in store – our new brand identity is a way of signalling the change.”*
