# Monthly Retail Round-Up - May 2018

## Dressipi brings you a round-up of the top retail news this May to keep you up to date.

### 1) Sainsbury’s Argos Merger with Asda

The announcement of an agreed merger between supermarket rivals Sainsbury’s and Asda came at the beginning of May. In a joint statement reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7030149.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTXpReFpHVTJaakl4TURVMyIsInQiOiJ2V2hkTWNsd3lNdnNaekN4dWs2K1NKa0xIVGdXeHFsZTJ3TEhUdUNmNXpxNUFoYnZJdWpHK0ZReFJoSHZ6bDN5U1wvSmJnQ1pwTlNmQ0Q2MWkxRTJCTzZjMlYxQ2oxSEM1a1FHMURNbWFJZzV5RTN2cEc0Y1VDeXJnZlZwTHJrT3cifQ%3D%3D), the two supermarkets stated, *“The retail sector is going through significant and rapid change, as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. Bringing Sainsbury’s and Asda together will result in a more competitive and more resilient business that will be better able to invest in price, quality, range and the technology to create more flexible ways for customers to shop.”*

Another [Drapers ](https://www.drapersonline.com/7030171.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWldWa1pXRTVaalk1TnpSayIsInQiOiJHbDJBYnBlK1F4SkVyOXNZaXpTbmhudzdRVmNcL2hqd09NTk5uMTh4TVFudzFvQllaVGxDY21ySEdHM0ZTdkZiUVU2aVA2bHMwQmFOcUhxTHlqQVo0cUVKOHBuTmR3RmdMVXB2UjNaRDdLT2pEZWZ5VHFjZGFKdW1weUVubUtiRDEifQ%3D%3D)article highlighted that *“Both are significant players in the clothing market: Asda ranks 5th by value with 3.5% market share and Sainsbury’s 15th with 2.1% in 2018, according to Global Data.”* This merger has created one of the UK’s largest grocery and clothing groups, however, Sainsbury’s Tu and George @ Asda will remain separate brands. Supermarket fashion has rapidly grown in recent years due to low prices and convenience and is putting pressure on high street value retailers such as Primark. 

George @ Asda was one of the first supermarket fashion brands, launching in 1990, with other supermarkets following such as Tesco’s F&F in 2001 and Sainsbury’s Tu in 2004. Supermarket fashion now accounts for £3.1bn annual clothing sales in the UK (Figures from Kantar WorldPanel, reported in [City A.M.](http://www.cityam.com/274427/suits-you-supermarket-fashion-turning-heads-uk-)).

### 2) Zara Unveils Futuristic Store

Zara’s flagship store in Westfield Stratford has reopened after months of refurbishment. A temporary, online-only store had been in its place since [January](https://dressipi.com/blog/monthly-retail-round-up-january-2018/), where shoppers could buy and collect online orders. Zara wanted to carry on this concept of integrating their digital online experience with their physical stores so, in addition to Women’s, Men’s and Kid’s, Zara have included a fourth section ‘Online’. Reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7030402.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT0dOak56a3laRGxsWkdVMiIsInQiOiJiZlwvcXI0TnBkTlVJK2N6TGRXbHk0akVCanczTCtBb0RcL2dRQ0pydkVlbCs4VDdhZnhBRG1yN3RQWHRIR0NtZCtSQ1F5V3JHQmh3Umhjc3d0XC8yYnBqcXJ0cXRsNVhtNDFJR3RLU1wvdmVrRmN4Uklrb0p0bDRzd093QTg0S2YxZkIifQ%3D%3D), this Online area includes:

* A till dedicated to returns
* Two automated online order collection points 

*“Shoppers scan QR or PIN codes they receive when they place orders online. Behind the pick-up point, a robotic arm collects trays and organises the packages optimally according to their size, and delivers orders in seconds.”* These robots can handle 2,400 orders at a time, and customers can collect purchases ordered in-store on the same day if ordered before 2pm. The futuristic store also includes:

* Interactive mirrors which detect the garment being held up by the customer, offering information on the garment, as well as options to complete the outfit.
* Employees with iPads, advising customers on products and accepting payments on the spot.
* A self-checkout area with a scanner that automatically recognises the product being purchased (no barcode scanning involved!).

According to [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/inditex-opens-the-zara-store-of-tomorrow-at-westfield-stratford/2018051729700), this high-tech store is, *“Specially designed to transform the customer experience by offering a seamless shopping experience using innovative technology.”*
