### 1) Sainsbury’s Argos Merger with Asda

The announcement of an agreed merger between supermarket rivals Sainsbury’s and Asda came at the beginning of May. In a joint statement reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7030149.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTXpReFpHVTJaakl4TURVMyIsInQiOiJ2V2hkTWNsd3lNdnNaekN4dWs2K1NKa0xIVGdXeHFsZTJ3TEhUdUNmNXpxNUFoYnZJdWpHK0ZReFJoSHZ6bDN5U1wvSmJnQ1pwTlNmQ0Q2MWkxRTJCTzZjMlYxQ2oxSEM1a1FHMURNbWFJZzV5RTN2cEc0Y1VDeXJnZlZwTHJrT3cifQ%3D%3D), the two supermarkets stated, *“The retail sector is going through significant and rapid change, as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. Bringing Sainsbury’s and Asda together will result in a more competitive and more resilient business that will be better able to invest in price, quality, range and the technology to create more flexible ways for customers to shop.”*

Supermarket fashion has rapidly grown in recent years due to low prices and convenience and is putting pressure on high street value retailers such as Primark. 

George @ Asda was one of the first supermarket fashion brands, launching in 1990, with other supermarkets following such as Tesco’s F&F in 2001 and Sainsbury’s Tu in 2004. Supermarket fashion now accounts for £3.1bn annual clothing sales in the UK (Figures from Kantar WorldPanel, reported in [City A.M.](http://www.cityam.com/274427/suits-you-supermarket-fashion-turning-heads-uk-)).
