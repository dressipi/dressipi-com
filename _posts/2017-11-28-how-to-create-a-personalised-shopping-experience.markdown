Natalie Theo, Dressipi’s Style Director describes the buzz term 'Personalisation', and explores how retailers can use it to create one to one shopping experiences for their customers that will delight and inspire them.

# How To Create A Personalised Shopping Experience

## ‘Personalisation’ is a buzz word in retail that will still undoubtedly be one of the hot topics going into 2018.

Creating relevant shopping experiences to every individual on a personal level will increasingly become a priority for retailers. How can true personalisation be achieved and what does it take to capture one of the most challenging yet crucial element, the emotional side of shopping and dressing? 

Personalisation starts with the customer and ends with the customer. It’s an opportunity for retailers to have an ongoing intimate conversation with shoppers 24/7, whilst gaining an understanding of:

* How they shop
* Whether or not they are confident when it comes to shopping
* How their lifestyle impacts purchase decisions
* What occasions they shop for
* What parts of their shape they find difficult to dress
* Do they enjoy following trends (or not)

These are all crucial data points that we continually capture and learn from, highlighting that putting the customer needs first enables us to create a [truly personalised shopping solution](https://dressipi.com/true-personalisation/) for our retail partners.

Thanks to each customer’s unique and ever evolving Fashion Fingerprint® (their unique fashion profile) and the fact that Dressipi has the largest set of product fit and style data available in the world today, retailer’s products are mapped to a customer as if it were the result of that very intimate discussion she might have had with a personal stylist in real time.

For many retailers personalisation is  likely to become a key focus in 2018. Firstly it represents an opportunity for retailers to empower better customer experiences, and secondly, increased revenue with a service that adds that ‘human touch’ to the customer journey and lets her know *“we’re listening to you”*.

We’ve always known at Dressipi right from the start that to turn that face to face real time personal shopping experience into algorithms that constantly learn, and evolve as the customer does, the style team and tech team would always work hand in hand, and that’s exactly what we do.
 
Fashion is emotional and constantly evolving. How customers think of fashion changes with time, inspiration and context which is why our algorithms take into account fashion specific information updated daily by the style team. This operates on many levels:

* Reviewing outfit combinations
* Understanding how people shop trends
* Style rules sets around shape, garments and must have styles
* Ensuring  we are keeping on-brand with each of our retail partners

We believe that these represent a key differentiator and enable us to truly [innovate](https://dressipi.com/solutions/innovation/) compared to many of our competitors’ purely click-based approach to personalisation (i.e. people like you clicked this, so you’ll probably like this).
 
Creating  personalised shopping experiences reduces the search costs for consumers reduces choice as we only show customers garments that suit their shape and style. It instills confidence in the purchases made: with outfitting customers learn how to style something they might be thinking of buying and to style it for different occasions suited to their needs and lifestyle. It champions versatility by showing how to wear a new purchase with something already in your wardrobe.


The highlights from the panel (and in turn, [the whitepaper](/downloads/how-to-make-your-data-work-harder-to-reduce-garment-return-rates-whitepaper/)) are as follows:

### 1) The main costs incurred by returns and how they impact the business

We identified 3 main areas of cost:

* Costs of getting product back into circulation
* Opportunity cost of not having available stock
* Restocking costs

### 2) Highlighting the quantity and quality of data issue

As mentioned earlier in this post, the data held by retailers is rarely good enough (in both quantity and quality) to predict and reduce returns.

At Dressipi, we can do far more accurate propensity modelling on customer profile features and their tendency to buy and keep certain garments. This is due to the very detailed data we collect on every customer, and the taxonomy we created for every product category, (tagging every single product with up to 40-50 features).

### 3) Focus on the right metrics to drive up revenues *and* margins

Retailers typically focus on conversion and gross sales, but this can be misleading and won’t always lead to margin improvement without due consideration being given to return rates.

### 4) Analyse your data to understand your key drivers

Returns broadly fall into the following areas:

* Customer behaviour
* Wrong products/features
* Misleading press/marketing images


Both Vicky and I agreed that returns are always going to be a feature of the retail industry, but at their current levels, they are too expensive and unsustainable. The future of the industry relies on retailers using their data in a smarter way and taking action to gain real clarity as to the key metrics that can drive revenue growth alongside profit/margin growth. This, alongside [one to one personalisation](/one-to-one-personalisation/) that provides richer and more relevant customer experiences, will ensure that retail stays ahead of the curve.
