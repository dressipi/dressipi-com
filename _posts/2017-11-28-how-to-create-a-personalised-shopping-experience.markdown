Natalie Theo, Dressipi’s Style Director describes the buzz term 'Personalisation', and explores how retailers can use it to create one to one shopping experiences for their customers that will delight and inspire them.

# How To Create A Personalised Shopping Experience

## ‘Personalisation’ is a buzz word in retail that will still undoubtedly be one of the hot topics going into 2018.

Creating relevant shopping experiences to every individual on a personal level will increasingly becomes a priority for retailers. How can true personalisation be achieved and what does it take to capture one of the most challenging yet crucial element, the emotional side of shopping and dressing? 

There is no silver bullet for solving this problem, as there are many reasons why items are returned, and each of these reasons will impact each retailer differently.

> At Dressipi we’ve established that firstly, it is important to get the right data in place, and to then use it to understand the quickest and easiest way to reduce returns without impacting or reducing revenue or sales. For example, is it customer behaviour, product/feature mix or different marketing behaviour causing high return rates?

My latest whitepaper explores insight from a panel both myself and Vicky Brock (formerly of Clear Returns) participated in at the recent Tech.Retail Week event. The discussion revolved around how retailers can make their data work harder to reduce garment return rates.

The highlights from the panel (and in turn, [the whitepaper](/downloads/how-to-make-your-data-work-harder-to-reduce-garment-return-rates-whitepaper/)) are as follows:

### 1) The main costs incurred by returns and how they impact the business

We identified 3 main areas of cost:

* Costs of getting product back into circulation
* Opportunity cost of not having available stock
* Restocking costs

### 2) Highlighting the quantity and quality of data issue

As mentioned earlier in this post, the data held by retailers is rarely good enough (in both quantity and quality) to predict and reduce returns.

At Dressipi, we can do far more accurate propensity modelling on customer profile features and their tendency to buy and keep certain garments. This is due to the very detailed data we collect on every customer, and the taxonomy we created for every product category, (tagging every single product with up to 40-50 features).

### 3) Focus on the right metrics to drive up revenues *and* margins

Retailers typically focus on conversion and gross sales, but this can be misleading and won’t always lead to margin improvement without due consideration being given to return rates.

### 4) Analyse your data to understand your key drivers

Returns broadly fall into the following areas:

* Customer behaviour
* Wrong products/features
* Misleading press/marketing images


Both Vicky and I agreed that returns are always going to be a feature of the retail industry, but at their current levels, they are too expensive and unsustainable. The future of the industry relies on retailers using their data in a smarter way and taking action to gain real clarity as to the key metrics that can drive revenue growth alongside profit/margin growth. This, alongside [one to one personalisation](/one-to-one-personalisation/) that provides richer and more relevant customer experiences, will ensure that retail stays ahead of the curve.
