### After 2 years of lockdowns and disruptions, UK fashion retail is beginning to steady. 

We expect the size of the UK fashion market in 2022 to be just about back to 2019 levels but retailers need to account for a big return rate hit looming on the horizon. 

Along with the massive shift to online retailing, average return rates from Aug - Oct 2021 are up +1% on 2019 rates. Together that means that there were 90m more returns in 2021 compared to 2019 and that number is set to reach 121m in 2022. The costs of processing these returns alone will cost the industry £1bn (up by ~£420m since 2019). This inefficiency will negatively impact EBIT margins by 1%.

An additional 121m returned items isn’t just going to hit margins, there is a substantial environmental impact too. These additional returns will be responsible for an additional 121m lbs of waste in landfill and 400k metric tons of CO2 (equivalent to 4,574 double-decker buses of waste and 1.6m hours worth of flight emissions!) 

Fashion Retail Over the last 12 months
Last year (due to store closures) we saw a big overall increase in online shopping (50%) but the mix of products shifted to reflect a more casual wardrobe. This change in product mix meant that most retailers had a real cash bonus as return rates dropped by 21% (8%pts) across the board. You can read more about this in our blog last year [here](https://dressipi.com/blog/reduced-return-rates-a-bonus-for-fashion-retailers/).

Now that the industry is steadying (with stores mostly open), the picture is different. 

Expected Size of Fashion Industry 2022 back to 2019 levels
The latest quarterly results across the industry show the market size is pretty much back to 2019 levels (with some clear winners and losers).We expect growth in 2022 to be limited due to inflation and further supply chain disruptions.

## 25-30% Permanent Shift to Online 

The pandemic has also accelerated the shift to online. We estimate there has been a permanent shift of 25-30% to ecommerce. Ecommerce now represents 50-60% of revenue for traditional B&M retailers. This is as we predicted back in [2021](https://dressipi.com/blog/reduced-return-rates-a-bonus-for-fashion-retailers/).

The average growth of the online channel for Bricks and Mortar retailers in the last 6 months vs 2020 is 24.7% (up 95% on 2019). Similarly, average growth rates for the online pure play retailers is 23%.

<br>

## Product Mix Back inline with 2019

The other big shift is a return to a more “return rate heavy” product mix. Dresses, Tops and Jeans/Bottoms are typically the 3 largest categories. Pre-pandemic dresses were typically 16% of the product mix, declined to 11%  in 2020 but Dresses are now back to above 2019 levels. The chart below shows the changes in product mix and the corresponding return rates for these categories. 

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_3.JPG"/></p>
<br>

This product mix change has increased the return rate by **2.17%**. 

## Casualisation of fashion

When you dig deeper into each category you can see that there is a move to a more casual wardrobe. The chart below illustrates the changes within Dresses. 

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_4.JPG"/></p>
<br>

This is the same across the board with return rates within categories reducing. Reducing the return rate by 1.27%. 

The combination of product mix change and the casualisation of fashion therefore gives an overall increase of 1% in 2019.

## Reasons for Returns

### Multiple Style Options is the big growth area in return reasons

Rather than rely on reason codes (that are less accurate), we use a data-driven methodology to get a sense of the reason for garments being returned. We split the returns into 3 categories:
* When size is the issue (when the same customer buys the same product in more than 1 size over any number of orders within a year)
* When style is the issue (when the same customer buys multiple options of the same category within the same order, having removed multiple size orders)
* When it is a single size and single category product

Typically the % of returns breaks down as follows:

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_6.JPG"/></p>
<br>

Although those reasons do vary by garment category.

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_7.JPG"/></p>
<br>

When you look at the return rates within each reason category, we typically see the below:

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_8.JPG"/></p>
<br>

When return rates for any multiple size purchase are at 85%, it suggests that the size wasn’t the issue but that the product wasn’t right in any case. 

And over lockdown we have seen the biggest rise was in customers buying multiple options (19%) but also in customers buying multiple sizes (11%) and a decrease in customers buying single size single product (-10%). 

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_9.JPG"/></p>
<br>

This suggests that customers are uncertain of what works best for them. Given both of the first 2 reasons have higher return rates this uncertainty will also be contributing to higher return rates. 

## Overall Return Rates

So all of this means that return rates for the period from Aug - Oct 2021 vs the same period in 2021 are up 1%. We predict therefore that the return rates for 2022 will be either inline or approximately 1% higher than 2019.

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_10.JPG"/></p>
<br>

## What this means for margins

Obviously, this shift to online retailing and return rates increase plays out very differently depending on whether it is an online pureplay or bricks and mortar retailer. 

Let’s assume 2 fictional retailers, both with gross revenues of £500m in 2019. The first is an online pureplay retailer and the other a traditional bricks and mortar retailer. Let’s assume each retailer follows the average movements within their category. 

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_11.JPG"/></p>
<br>

**Online pureplay retailers** are having an easier time of it, with average growth rates over 20% and reduced return rates in 2020 and 2021, surplus cash has been considerable (and at least a decent buffer against the recent increased supply chain costs). We predict 2022 return rates to be inline with or slightly higher than 2019 and so although the online retailers will have additional growth, we expect their overall EBIT margins to be negatively impacted by about 1% (not including impacts from supply chains).

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 900px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_12.JPG"/></p>
<br>

**For B&M retailers**, it is a different story. Although the online channel has doubled since 2019, overall revenues have declined. So, even with the decrease in return rates that gave the online retailers a boost to their contribution margin. It doesn’t make up for the loss in retail sales. As 2022 reverts to 2019 levels but with a higher online percentage and increased return rates, we expect the traditional players to see their EBIT margins negatively impacted by 8% or an additional cost of £15m. Again, this does not include the increased costs of supply chains.
