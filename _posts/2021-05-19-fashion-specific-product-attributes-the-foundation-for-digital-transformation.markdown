Digital services like Netflix and Spotify have been able to rapidly transform their industries thanks to the abundance of data available to them. In fashion however, while there is plenty of data available on marketing channels and transactions, retailers never had quality data for what the customers actually care about the most - **the clothes**.

Most retailers have a handful of attributes they think are necessary. Products tend to be tagged with basic attributes such as neckline, length and fabric but these are mostly used for paid search and site navigation - missing out on value in both supply chain optimisation (e.g. size ratios, returns and product development) and personalisation (e.g. recommendations, editorial content and customer journeys). They are also likely being updated manually, posing a scalability challenge and leading to inaccuracies and inconsistency in the attributes. 

Digital transformation depends on the quality and accuracy of the data it is built upon. There are a number of things that come into play for retailers when advancing this key area of their business:

### 1) The More Attributes the Better

One of the key benefits of machine learning is its ability to sort through huge amounts of data and find patterns humans would never see. Deep learning models are pushing this even further in recent years. The more data that can be fed into these models the better - especially because different attributes drive value to different parts of the business, often in unexpected ways.

For example, when considering how many of each size should be stocked, retailers tend to only think about a product’s fit and length. However, through analysing Dressipi’s unique taxonomy of over 1000 attributes, we found that necklines, embellishment details and even colour had an impact on how many of each size should be stocked. 

This pair of white leather trousers had 8% more sales for sizes 6 & 8 than the equivalent pair in black:

### 2) Accuracy & Consistency is Key

Imagine if your revenue figures were sometimes wrong by 5%. Obviously, this would make understanding your sales performance each week impossible - and the same is true for understanding customer behaviour through product attributes. 

For example, our analysis has shown that when women with large bust sizes buy crew neck products, 5% more of them return it compared to if they had bought products with round necks. 

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 400px;" src ="/uploads/Attributes_3.JPG"/></p>

Small details like this can have a big impact, however they can be very difficult for computer vision to label accurately. The differences between these necklines are small, only varying in the way a person’s collarbone is shown:

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 600px;" src ="/uploads/Attributes_4.JPG"/></p>

Dressipi has an average of 20 attributes per product, across thousands of products. If 95% of them were tagged correctly, that would mean every product would be incorrectly labelled in some way - so we have to get as close to 100% as possible. 

Once accuracy and consistency are achieved, retailers can deploy the best possible propensity models and personalisation components. Without them however, these efforts are doomed to fail.

### 3) Be Customer Focused

To accurately predict customer behaviour, retailers need to see product features in the same way that customers do. However, current product attributes are typically designed for business users: for example, retailers will often end up with a 'Petite' category that has bundled together dresses and jeans - a nightmare to analyse. 

It’s not only data models that benefit from customer-focused attributes however. Dressipi’s [Data Insight Hub](https://dressipi.com/closer-look-at-our-data-insight-hub/) links up our attributes with transaction or visit data, allowing buyers, merchandisers and marketing teams to view their data through a customer’s point of view and make truly informed decisions based on what they really want.

### 4) Attributes Are As Much an Art as a Science

Clothes can’t be truly understood broken down into their individual attributes - we also have to understand how they work together. A floor-length dress could be suitable only for formal events, or it could be flexible enough for casual and creative work too.

[Fashion trends are also a set of attributes](https://dressipi.com/blog/a-trend-is-a-set-of-data-points/), which means your attributes can’t be created by data scientists alone. At Dressipi, our stylist team works very closely with our data science team to make sure that our attributes are written in the language of fashion, but are also created in a well defined, flexible way to allow them to be used and combined in our models. 

This combination of expertise means we can create high-performance models, but also translate those models into plain english for retailers to understand.

## The Benefits are Endless

The benefits product data can provide are vast, with high quality attributes promising improvements to many core aspects of retailer’s businesses. 

For example, they go a long way to solving the ‘cold start’ problem, as no product is ever completely new - it has a set of product attributes that already has visit and sales propensities to learn from. The risk of new products when planning ranges can be reduced by using attributes to answer questions like:

* How many of our customers like these features?
* What's the return rate going to be like? 
* What is missing in our range? 

The key to answering these questions is making product data available in a format that's simple for buying and design teams to understand and act on.

## Dressipi Can Help

One of the key pillars to Dressipi’s services is detailed, consistent, fashion-specific attribute data, enhancing every product from a taxonomy of thousands of features. It’s a necessity for retailers to gain a deeper understanding of every single one of their products and adapt to the future of fashion retail.
