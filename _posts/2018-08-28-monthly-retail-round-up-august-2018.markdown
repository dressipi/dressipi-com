# Monthly Retail Round-Up - August 2018

## At Dressipi we like to be right up to date with retail news. Here are the top stories this August.

### 1) Sainsbury’s Joins Amazon to go Check-Out Free

Sainsbury’s has taken a leaf out of Amazon’s book by trialling new scan, pay and go technology. 

Sainsbury’s SmartShop app allows customers to, *“use their smartphones to scan shopping as they go and then pay for it through the app, from anywhere in the store, using Apple Pay”*. This development has positioned themselves as the first retailer in the UK to offer customers the ability to shop check-out free.

Check-out free shopping is quickly on the rise with *“In-store contactless payments predicted to reach 2 trillion dollars by 2020, counting for 1 in 3 in-store transactions”* ([Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/sainsbury-s-trials-till-free-shopping/2018081438316)). No-till payments will eventually be a necessity for all retailers as customer demand more convenient and quicker ways to shop. 

Currently, this new technology is only available to buy groceries, however according to [Retail Systems](http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Sainsburys_Scan_And_Go_Trial_London.php), *“Sainsbury’s will use customer feedback to develop and improve the experience before testing the technology in different store types and locations.”*

### 2) Tommy Hilfiger Launches Collection that Tracks What You Wear

Merging technology and fashion, luxury brand, Tommy Hilfiger has launched a smart-clothing line. [The Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/tommy-hilfiger-xplore-technology-a3899606.html) reported that Tommy Hilfiger’s latest collection, Tommy Jeans XPLORE *“uses smart technology to track the items you’re wearing”*. Brands will now be able to know how their products are being used after they leave the store. 

Each piece of clothing comes with *“a smart Bluetooth chip from [Awear Solutions](https://www.awearsolutions.com/#about)”*. This connects the product to the dedicated iOS Tommy Jeans Xplore app, which *“creates a direct line of communication between the Tommy Jeans Xplore product and consumers”* ([WWD](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/tommy-hilfiger-launches-tommy-jeans-xplore-1202764296/)).

The customer can opt out of this, however if they choose not to, Tommy Hilfiger will know how many times the garment has been worn and the circumstances in which they have worn it. Retailers will be able to get data and post-sale analytics on product usage and therefore, will be able to tailor promotions for loyal customers (concert tickets, gift cards etc).
