## Dressipi, the world’s only fashion prediction platform, brings you a round up of the top retail news this February to keep you up to date.

The technology, which is only in its early stages, scours a customer’s social media images along with their saved photos to create a virtual mannequin customised to their body shape. It takes into consideration their job, where they live and what they do in their free time, to predict a customer’s style, identify possible suggestions and create bespoke outfits. 

Reported in the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/26/future-fashion-retail-just-swipe-away-amazon-patent-reveals/), customers can also *“search my look”*, *“randomise outfits”*, and *“find more like this”* along with liking or disliking the suggestions on screen. This is all in aim to improve the customers online experience as well as reducing the number of returns due to different styles and sizes ordered.
