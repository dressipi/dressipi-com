# Monthly Retail Round-Up - November 2018

## November has been a busy month in the world of retail with Black Friday deals lasting longer than ever and lots of other retail news. Here are the top stories to keep you up to date.

### 1) Record-Breaking Black Friday 

Black Friday is the biggest discounting day of the year and has been a hot topic of conversation this November. This year many retailers started their campaigns earlier, with discounts lasting up to 2 whole weeks and a number of retailers offering up to 50% off selected products. Even Jigsaw failed to stick to their pricing manifesto of 2015 that said it would not reduce prices in season and launched their first Black Friday Sale with 20% off selected products ([Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/jigsaw-in-black-friday-u-turn/7033139.article?blocktitle=Most-popular&contentID=-1)).

Also reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7033188.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT0RreE0yTXdNMlJoTW1VeiIsInQiOiJJOEdSWDV1RmxSM3FvK1pnU3h0NmlHcTJJK1VicXlYODBKdVBkQVFHM1FOc3Q2YnpOZk5seThwOGxyT0FnbThWc3pxMUo1NW1XUmkwTzJOajV1Q0xWa3BtZHJYSzBPMTJvaTNhUklqRjQwb1Vvd2xzQVV4aE05dmVEQzZHdXJPeSJ9), data from Lovethesales.com showed us that more and more retailers are taking part and offering more deals with larger discounts.
* A total of 72% more UK retailers are taking part in Black Friday this year than in 2017
* There are currently 26% more Black Friday deals on offer than last year
* The average discount is 37%, compared with 33% in 2017 and 30% in 2016
* A total of 51% of all retail products are currently discounted, and 82% of products will drop in price over the Black Friday weekend

* Shoppers spent £1.49bn online with UK retailers on Black Friday. That was 7.3% ahead of the same day last year, but didn’t meet IMRG forecasts of +13.2%. (*IMRG estimates*)
* On Black Friday itself, footfall was 5.4% down compared to the same time last year, and continued to be down over Saturday (-5.6%) and Sunday (-4.3%). (*Springboard*)

### 2) Asos Rolls Out Fit Technology

[Retail Systems](http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/ASOS_Rolls_Out_AI_Driven_Sizing_Feature.php) reported that *“Asos is rolling out an artificial intelligence (AI) sizing tool across its global websites and mobile apps.”*

The partnership with [Fit Analytics](https://www.fitanalytics.com/), helps Asos provide bespoke sizing recommendations for all their customers, based on data from previous purchases and returns. For a more improved and personalised result, customers can answer 3 additional questions about height, weight and fit preference.

Andy Berks, Digital Product Director, Asos said in a press release, reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7033123.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTldWaE9EZzFPREl3TkRBeSIsInQiOiJ2Smp4Y1d2cmZKK2NNdWRpaDYxdFA5NWh6MENzTmE2TDYxXC9PZVhrRUNxMittTkRUdWthbXUwUWpEXC9nTklOQW12bWw1eU54dlwvbmlmM05jZ1diOHlcL0kzd0d1YzFMWHVBelJaSFhKbHBUTEFTc1FPb2RmcUJrNlo0WDNlcjRaQkIifQ%3D%3D), *“We want to do all we can to make sure our customers are getting the right size, first time. This is where Asos Fit Assistant comes in – we can now offer personalised size recommendations across Asos collections, exclusive labels and fashion favourites.”*

[Returns cost a huge amount to retailers every year](https://dressipi.com/how-to-decrease-your-return-rate/), with many customers buying multiple sizes. The Fit Assistant feature will help customers get the sizing right the first time, therefore eliminating ordering multiple sizes and improving customer experience. A benefit to both the retailer and the customer.

### 3) Matalan’s Omnichannel Experience

Fashion and home retailer, Matalan has launched an initiative this November with the purpose of improving their omnichannel strategy and customer experience.

Reported in [Fashion Network](https://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Matalan-opens-UX-centre-in-Knowsley,1037232.html#.W_wtSuj7Q2w), *“Matalan has opened a user experience lab in its head office in Knowsley in an effort to better understand its consumers’ shopping journey.”* Matalan proposes to bring customers to the UX lab to interact with them more frequently. This will help them get a wider understanding of their customers online shopping journeys and behaviour, along with feedback on their omnichannel proposition, in an aim to find new solutions and improvements.

Paul Hornby, Director of Ecommerce, Matalan (reported in [Fashion Network](https://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Matalan-opens-UX-centre-in-Knowsley,1037232.html#.W_wtSuj7Q2w)) said, *“Our UX Lab re-enforces our customer-centric, omnichannel ambitions. We’ve always had the opportunity to interact with our customers in store but haven’t had the same opportunity online. That has now changed and this step-change in our access to qualitative data from real customers will help us continue to improve the omnichannel customer experience.”*

### 4) N Brown Partners with Decoded
