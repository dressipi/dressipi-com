# Monthly Retail Round-Up - November 2018

## November has been a busy month in the world of retail with Black Friday deals lasting longer than ever and lots of other retail news. Here are the top stories to keep you up to date.

### 1) Record-Breaking Black Friday 

Black Friday is the biggest discounting day of the year and has been a hot topic of conversation this November. This year many retailers started their campaigns earlier, with discounts lasting up to 2 whole weeks and a number of retailers offering up to 50% off selected products. Even Jigsaw failed to stick to their pricing manifesto of 2015 that said it would not reduce prices in season and launched their first Black Friday Sale with 20% off selected products ([Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/jigsaw-in-black-friday-u-turn/7033139.article?blocktitle=Most-popular&contentID=-1)).
