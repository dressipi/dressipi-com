# How To Make Your Data Work Harder To Reduce Garment Return Rates

It comes as no surprise that returns are expensive business for retailers, carrying a hefty hidden cost. They can impact so many areas of operations, with the poor quality and sparsity of data held by many retailers exacerbating the issue. Everything from the lack of data on the customer (their preferences, who they are), the transactions data (often incomplete and housed in various different locations) and the product data (sparsely and inaccurately attributed) all impact how retailers may find it difficult to truly understand what is contributing to high return rates.

There is no silver bullet for solving this problem, as there are many reasons why items are returned, and each of these reasons will impact each retailer differently.
 
At Dressipi we’ve established that firstly, it is important to get the right data in place, and to then use it to understand the quickest and easiest way to reduce returns without impacting or reducing revenue or sales. For example, is it customer behaviour, product/feature mix or different marketing behaviour causing high return rates? 
 
My latest whitepaper explores insight from a panel both myself and Vicky Brock (formerly of Clear Returns) participated in at the recent Tech.Retail Week event. The discussion revolved around how retailers can make their data work harder to reduce garment return rates.
 
The highlights from the panel (and in turn, [the whitepaper](/) are as follows:
