### After 2 years of lockdowns and disruptions, apparel/fashion retail is recovering in the US. 

We expect the size of the US market in 2022 to be up 5.1% on 2019 (higher than the UK - which will be just about returning to 2019 levels). However, the less good news is that retailers need to account for a big return rate hit looming on the horizon. 

Along with the shift to online retailing, average return rates from Aug - Dec 2021 are back to the pre-pandemic levels of around 25% in the US. Together that means that the volume of returns has increased significantly. 

We estimate that in the apparel/fashion segment there were 200m more returned items in 2021 compared to 2019 and that number is set to reach 379m in 2022. The costs of processing these returns alone will cost the industry $2.5bn (up by ~$850m since 2019). This inefficiency will negatively impact EBIT margins by 0.5%.

An additional 380m returned items isn’t just going to hit margins, there is a substantial environmental impact too. These additional returns will be responsible for an additional 380m lbs of waste in landfill and 1200k metric tons of CO2 (equivalent to 36,014 SUV’s of waste and 5.2m hours worth of flight emissions!) 

## Expected Size of Apparel Industry 2022 back to above 2019 levels

The latest quarterly results across the industry show the market size is pretty much back to 2019 levels (with some clear winners and losers). Even before recent events, we were expecting growth in 2022 to be limited due to inflation and further supply chain disruptions and spiking warehousing costs.

## 11% Permanent Shift to Online 

The pandemic has also accelerated the shift to online. We estimate there has been a permanent shift of 11% to ecommerce. Ecommerce now represents an average of 35% of revenue for apparel retailers in the US (vs 24% in 2019).

The average growth of the online channel for retailers in the last 6 months of 2021 vs 2020 is 13% (up 54% on 2019).

## Deeper Dive into what is driving return rates

Although the mix of product purchases has moved to a more casual make up, the changes in return rates are less as a result of the mix of products and more within each category.

<br>

## Category mix suggesting a casualisation of apparel choices

We are seeing a rise in the purchases of Jeans, Sportswear, Tops and Knitwear with a slight decrease in the purchases of dresses and more formal jackets. 

In 2021 dresses and tops were the highest categories at approximately 20% and 26% of the overall womenswear product mix. Within those categories, dresses saw return rate increases by 16% and tops increase by 12%. This was mostly due to people buying multiple options.

## Sustainability Impact 

There are 2 other big shifts that have taken hold over the last 2 years

### 1) Sustainability

As one of the biggest offenders when it comes to sustainability, fashion has a long way to go to improve its sustainability credentials. Whilst the consumer does not yet  always vote with their wallet on this one, sentiments are definitely changing.  Most retail bosses understand that even if their consumer is not completely there, most governments are. There is now a necessity to ensure their businesses are more sustainable (2nd biggest opportunity and challenge as stated in the McKinsey’s latest “State of Fashion report 2022”)

<p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px; width: 400px;" src ="/uploads/Returns2022_BoF.png"/></p>
<br>

But this is not just about better materials, there is so much every fashion retailer can do very quickly TODAY to lessen their impact on the environment. 

Returns are just one example. Online returns are typically 3x higher than instore returns. Online returns typically take longer and depending on seasons and styles can be tricky to resell. According to [Optaro](https://info.optoro.com/hubfs/The%20Optoro%202020%20Impact%20Report.pdf) online returns are responsible for 14% more waste. They calculate that every 100m returned items results in approximately 100m lbs of waste in landfill and 300k metrics tons of CO2 emitted. 

Returns are a natural cost of doing business online but that minimum natural cost is at least 20% lower than the current 28% return rate.

### 2) Data driven retailing

On the one hand, the rise and rise of SheIn proves that the consumer isn’t really there yet from a sustainability point of view but on the flipside, it more than proves the power of data driven retailing. 

Now that the apparel retailers’ online revenue is growing, retailers have the data they need to implement much better retail practices to ensure that as retailers, the right products in the right quantities and right sizes are produced and that customers are buying the right items in the first place. 

Harnessing the power of this data can significantly improve the customer experience, reduce returns to a much lower level and reduce the waste every fashion retailer produces. 

## What Can Apparel Retail Bosses Do About it

**Make someone in the c-suite responsible for returns:** Whilst most apparel retailers understand the impact their returns experience can have on customer loyalty and their bottom line, it always amazes us that no one person in the business owns this metric. 

**Take the time to analyse the data to state the problem (rather than trying to solve a problem you assume exists):** Most retailers assume that confusing sizing is the core reason for returns (and, to be honest, so did we when we started!) but a deeper look at the data tells a very different story. We have had much better success reducing returns with our return rate propensity model feeding into the recommendations. Only showing customers items they are likely to keep, it turns out, is a quicker and easier way to reduce them. 

As a side note here, it kind of makes sense, 70-80% of any retailer’s revenue comes from their top 20-30% of customers and they typically know their size. Those heavier customers are also responsible for the bulk of the returns so is more likely to be other reasons than size. 

**AI Artificial intelligence is going to become increasingly important in managing returns:** Both in terms of what a customer buys and how the whole logistics process works. There are plenty of companies that are there to help retailers minimise this issue. But, going back to the first point, retailers need to be ready with someone in the c-suite owning the metric, get to grips with technology and be ready to transform their returns processes.

# Prediction for 2022

1) **Mid market squeeze:** as inflationary pressures set in, luxury is likely to be more resilient whereas consumers who feel the squeeze will trade down to the value retailers

2) **35% of apparel retailers’ revenue will be from online channel**

3) **B&M retailers will see additional pressure on margins:** we expect the growth of online to continue to grow (probably by a similar 10-13%). That, with the additional return rates, means retailers will need to tighten their belts to pay for the squeeze

4) **Return rates will be in line with 2019:** depending on inflation
