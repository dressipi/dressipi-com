# Retail Business Technology Expo

## The Retail Business Technology Expo (RBTE) held at Kensington Olympia is the largest retail solutions event dedicated to helping retailers map out their future strategies.

In this rapidly changing world of retail, and with the increasing use of technology, there is a mounting pressure for retailers to understand what they can do to bring themselves to the front of the pack.

There were many industry experts present who shared their thoughts, with some fascinating panel discussions. Key highlights included:

1. ## *“In-store shopping is never going away.”* Alison Wiltshire, Global Practice Lead, Retail and Consumer Goods, BT

Despite recent reports of store closure dominating the press, the importance of bricks and mortar retail is one shared by many. Bruno Pavlovsky, Fashion President, Chanel recently told [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7029147.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1dNMU1tVTVZall6TnpNMiIsInQiOiJyanV6T3E3VWVNZG10TEVLd2UzM0JIUll4Q2NoQ0xrVVRwZkJXSXd4WnkzeUllRzNDcFdVKytIdWR6bVdXemx0ZklUQmN2WUllSEVoV0p1a1ZDTDRkTWdWeHRzeEZpaytYOUJoeVg0NVJOWXV2VHZkM0JodVNYalJHMzJVUkRZWSJ9), *“We strongly believe that digital will never replace the feeling of being in a fitting room and trying on a Chanel piece.” *

Customers still like shopping in-store - *"81% of UK consumers see the physical store as vital to the shopping experience"* ([Internet Retailing](https://internetretailing.net/themes/-while-81-of-consumers-prefer-physical-stores-so-a-third-can-showroom)) therefore retailers need to start thinking about how to pull more customers in. Rachel Humphrey, Director of PR & Partnerships, Birchbox explained, *“stores are a huge opportunity to connect with our customer.”* Physical stores are needed, retailers just need to figure out how to get the most out of them.

Retailers have to make their stores a destination. *“There has to be a reason for going there and it has to be an experience,”* highlighted Daniel Bobroff, Founder and Former Investment Director, ASOS Ventures. Many brands are doing this well, such as Topshop’s flagship store at Oxford Circus which over the years has created a number of unique experiences including turning part of the ground floor into the set of ‘Stranger Things’. 

There has been a lot of investment in in-store technology, as customers want a similarly convenient experience to what they get shopping online - *“The successful retailers are those that are truly omnichannel”* stated Ken Daly, CEO, JML. Furthermore, retailers want to know as much as possible about their customers when they walk through that door, such as whether they have recently bought something or whether they are considering purchasing something online.
