### The fashion industry accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

This is more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined ([Europarl](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20201208STO93327/the-impact-of-textile-production-and-waste-on-the-environment-infographic)). Retailers must urgently work to reduce this staggering figure. They need to create a drive for fundamental change in one of the least sustainable industries in the world. 

Many retailers have started to address the huge impact they have on the planet through various supply chain initiatives. Simultaneously, customers are changing their behavior with preferences for sustainably produced or second-hand garments.

However, change is not happening fast enough. The future depends on retailers changing the entire way we consume fashion, by both buying, and selling, better. This can happen by driving both back end efficiencies, and front-end experiences.

This is where Dressipi can help. We enable fashion retailers to grow sustainably - through unique fashion data and prediction models. 

## Reduce Waste with AI-Driven Product Forecasting

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aslaugmagnusdottir/2020/05/13/fashions-next-normal/?sh=ec3601578f38), overproduction in the US fashion industry runs at an incredible 30 â€“ 40% each season. Solving this problem is fundamental to a sustainable fashion industry.

Dressipi helps retailers optimize product assortments & size ratios on a garment specific level - with a 90% lower error margin. This facilitates a shift to a more demand-led (and hugely less wasteful!) business model.

When considering how much of each size to stock, retailers consider style and length. However, when analyzing a deeper, better set of data retailers would see that neckline, embellishment and even color play a major part. This cream pair of leather trousers had 8% more sales in sizes 6 & 8 than the equivalent pair in black.
