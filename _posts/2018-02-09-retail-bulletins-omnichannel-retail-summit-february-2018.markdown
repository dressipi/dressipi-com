Highlights from this year's Omnichannel Retail Summit, hosted by Retail Bulletin.

# Omnichannel. Or is it ‘Multichannel’? How about ‘A Single View of the Customer’?

## Many buzzwords within the industry are used to describe what is essentially understanding customer behaviour across all shopping channels to deliver the best possible experience from start to finish.

Connecting that customer journey is gold dust for retailers. Whether its increasing brand loyalty, boosting acquisition and retention or driving sales, the omnichannel experience (when done correctly) has the potential to be transformative for a business.

In order to truly understand the intent and preferences of customers, their offline and online interactions with a brand should not exist separately, but rather work together, with data being the foundation that allows customers to have seamless (and accurate) interactions with that brand.

Of course, this is easier said than done.

As the title suggests, this year’s Omnichannel Retail Summit, hosted by The Retail Bulletin focused on *‘How Omnichannel Investment is Driving the Future of Businesses’*. With a lineup of fantastic leaders from the wider retail industry, the day-long event included lively interactive panels and thought leadership presentations all centred around *‘providing the best ‘total’ retail experience’*. 

My key learnings from the event include the following:

## 1) Retailers are Beginning to Focus on Strong Interactive Experiences 

Stefan Schmidhammer, IT Retail Innovation Manager at Swarovski spoke extensively about their “Sparkle Pop Up” in Milan and Toronto, which didn’t have any physical products for sale. 

The concept was based around a virtual try-on stand which launched at the end of 2017. Customers could virtually try on jewellery to then buy and have fun with selfie screens and Snapchat style interactions. Apparently, it is very difficult to replicate the sparkle from Swarovski products on screen, so they spent some time perfecting this. 

While it is undoubtedly exciting to see businesses experimenting with new ways of interacting with their customers, it is a little unclear how these experiences create value and deliver on a businesses KPI’s. These sorts of experiments also strike me as being difficult to measure in terms of the ROI.

## 2) Don’t Be Scared of Data - Be Excited About What It Can Do For You

Retailers have an abundance of data, however not all of it will be useful and there is bound to be data sparsity in areas concerning the customer for (example capturing attitudinal data and personal preferences). Where the challenge lies is how to package this data into a useful and insightful format that helps better decision making.

Andrew Mann, Vice President Insight, Pricing & Digital CRM at Asda firmly believes that you should always point your business strategy towards where the organisation (and ultimately the customer) wants to go. Data can help you do this in 4 ways:

Transformational Understanding of the Business 
- Getting to know your business inside out and better than anyone else


Delivering the Most Relevant, Inspirational Messaging 
-  Clever storytelling which makes sure people see the most relevant stories for them


Creation of New Services
- Building new experiences that didn’t exist previously


Creation of Stronger Communities
	- Ensuring people in the business and customers feel part of something


## 3) Asos profits rise, but can they ever beat Amazon?

[The Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/asos-uk-revival-shows-online-retailers-escaped-store-gloom) reported on Asos Plc’s recently published results. Sales in the UK (Asos’s largest market) rose 23% to £300.9 million in the four months ended December 31st.

BoF stated that Asos *‘profited at the expense of its store-based rivals’*, emphasising the growing influence of pureplays, and the increasing need for bricks and mortar retailers to step up their in-store offering if they are to differentiate themselves. 

But even Asos are trying to find ways to defend themselves against the likes of Amazon, who continue to innovate, introducing services such as same-day delivery. According to the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/795935ac-0205-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5), Amazon are *‘set to overtake Macy’s to be the largest seller of clothing to Americans this year’*. Analysts Nomura estimate that ‘apparel could be a $45bn-$85bn business for Amazon by 2020’.  These statistics are a very real threat as they make fashion their top priority.

If the likes of Asos are taking measures to differentiate themselves, then bricks and mortar retailers should even more so. A recent article by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/fashion-is-getting-personal-as-brands-battle-for-shoppers.html) states that brands are in a constant battle for claiming a greater share of customer spend, *‘Retailers are finding their websites must mimic some of the same experiences that could be offered in a physical store, bringing the same level of expertise that an associate would give in helping a customer make a selection’*.



## 4) WIRED’s six ways that new technology will revolutionise shopping

With constant reports of store closures ([896 high street shops closed in 2016](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer)) and declining footfall, [WIRED](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer) is adamant that *‘Retailers must combine emotion with innovation if they want to survive growing consumer demand and economic pressure’*.

The article puts an emphasis on re-thinking personal assistance using AI, as well as improving payment methods. You can find another really interesting article [here](https://www.kamcity.com/namnews/uk-and-ireland/supermarkets/amazon-go-tech-will-bring-new-era-personalised-shopping-wont-kill-human-interaction/) by KamCity on how despite the launch of new check-out free technology (Amazon Go), human interaction is still very important and will be used to *‘complement and enhance the relationships customers have with human sales staff’*. 

The WIRED article also comments on how luxury retailers must think more strategically about extending conversations they have with their customers in-store into *‘after-sales care and analytics*’.
