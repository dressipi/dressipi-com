Sometimes a trend is as much about a style of clothing or a colour or pattern, as it is about how we style an outfit. One of the key trends this season is a maxi dress (item of clothing) \+ knee-high or over-the-top-boots (item of clothing) styled together (very 70’s mood trend) and finished off with a slightly oversized vamped up denim shearling jacket (70s trend) and a bit of glitz (ornate embellishment trend).

Do you get the picture? What’s more this look is perfect for day or night as a pair of coloured or metallic high heeled boots is the new alternative to an evening sandal.
