Some of the best articles from the world of retail and its supporting industries.

## Whether you’re reading this at home, at work, surrounded by your children, flatmates or family members, we hope you are well and healthy.

## As mentioned in our [February Monthly Round-Up](https://dressipi.com/blog/monthly-retail-round-up-february-2020/), COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the retail industry. There have been many stories of temporary store closures however I wanted to outline some of the positive news surrounding the virus. 

## So between the virtual pub quizzes, Zoom calls and Netflix Parties, have a read about what some retailers are doing to help in this challenging time.


### 1) Supplying Protective Equipment

Larger retailers are using their connections and logistics capabilities to help with the provision of masks and hospital gowns, for example, reported in [The Industry Fashion](https://www.theindustry.fashion/mango-donates-two-million-masks-to-spanish-hospitals-in-covid-19-fight/), *“Mango is to donate two million masks to Spanish hospitals.” *

Here are two other retailers helping to fight against the coronavirus:

Reported in [The Retail Bulletin](https://www.theretailbulletin.com/fashion/hm-group-to-supply-protective-equipment-for-hospitals-23-03-2020/), H&M is *“arranging for its supply chain to switch to producing personal protective equipment for hospitals and health care workers”.*

Anna Gedda, Head of Sustainability, H&M Group, said *“The coronavirus is dramatically affecting each and every one of us, and H&M Group is, like many other organisations, trying our best to help in this extraordinary situation. We see this is as a first step in our efforts to support in any way we can. We are all in this together, and have to approach this as collectively as possible.”*
