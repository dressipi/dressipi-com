title: 'Reduced Return Rates: A Bonus For Fashion Retailers...But Don''t Get Too Comfortable'

It’s no secret that COVID-19 has accelerated the shift to digital commerce within fashion retail. Over the last 12 months, UK womenswear retailers have seen their online revenues increase by an average of 18%.

Another area to deliver a significant boost to the cash position of fashion retailers is the huge drop in return rates for online orders. Womenswear return rates have fallen from an average of 35.4% to 27.8% over the COVID period. This near 8% point (-21%) drop has a huge impact on cash flow and contributed profit. Through this post we will be referring to actual percentage point drops not the relative %,  unless specifically stated. 

To illustrate the impact of this reduction in return rates, take a retailer with online revenue of £100m. Even with no revenue growth, an 8% point drop in return rates delivers a 19% relative improvement in contributed margin, approx £5m of additional cash (assuming all distribution and return costs per return remained the same). <p style="text-align:center"><img style="margin-left: 0px" src ="/uploads/Returns%201.PNG"/></p>

While this is a well needed cash injection, we expect fashion retailers to see a very different return rate profile in the second half of 2021. Like many behavioural scientists have predicted, we expect pent up demand will lead to a "roaring 20s" of our own as restrictions are lifted. The subsequent increase in evening and occasion wear will shift return rates back to above 2019 levels. Unless properly budgeted and planned for, this will eat into the precious cash reserves of retailers.

Luckily, the depth and breadth of customer and garment data that retailers have access to means that they can accurately forecast their return rates and ensure there are no nasty shocks whilst firming up forecasts and budgets for 2021. 

So let’s dig a little deeper and look at the detail behind those declining return rates.

### Change In What Customers Are Buying

At Dressipi, we have analysed the return rates of our UK clients (who represent approximately 15% of the online womenswear market) over 6 months from March-October 2019 vs the same period in 2020. We can see that return rates have dropped from 35.4% to 27.6%. At a high level this breaks down as follows:

* ***Change in mix of Product Category:*** 1.7% points of the drop in returns is due to a change in the mix of products - fewer dresses, jumpsuits and skirts but more jeans, tops and pyjamas. 
* Change within each Product Category: 6.1% points of the drop in returns is due to decreases within each category (for example dresses return rates have dropped from 51% to 44%).
