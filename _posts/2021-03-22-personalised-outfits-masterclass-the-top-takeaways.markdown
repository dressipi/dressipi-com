### The main takeaways from our Personalised Outfits Masterclass.

We have always known outfits are at the core of how customers shop. Taking you back to when Dressipi first started, the team, including Style Director Natalie Theo, took 200 women, who uploaded 30 items from their wardrobe. From these items and 5 new recommended items to update their wardrobe, 20 outfits per customer were created. That is a total of 6000 unique outfits and 1000 new items recommended to update clients’ wardrobes. A huge 75% of these 1000 products were bought.

> *“If this could be turned into technology that would be pretty amazing.”* - **Natalie Theo** 

Natalie and Software Engineer, Marija Mandic spoke at our recent Masterclass about how we took that manual expertise and turned it into something technical that could be scaled and create real value. Watch the [full masterclass here](https://dressipi.com/downloads/personalised-outfits/) and read our key takeaways below:

## 1) The quality and accuracy of attributes is critical 

At Dressipi we have around 35 different attributes per product. This taxonomy of garment features is completely unique to Dressipi, not existing anywhere else in the retail industry. And it is this taxonomy that allows us to scale this technology, building 100 million outfits per night for John Lewis.
