## Is your product data up to scratch? Product data, and product attributes specifically, have the amazing capacity to improve many retail processes - including search relevancy, recommendations accuracy and inventory forecasting.

But to get good outcomes it’s not enough to have the same data as your competitors, you also need more accurate and differentiated attribution. Generic data will get you started but better and unique data helps you excel.

We’ve pulled out some of the key benefits of great product data:

### 1) Product Discoverability

One of the most important factors in retail is product discoverability. A shopper can’t buy what they can’t find. Data that describe the features of a product in detail and how and where it can be used will help improve rankings in search engines as well as increase accuracy of search results. Most retailers have around seven main attribute classes including length, color, neckline etc. This is only a fraction of what is required to tell a compelling and complete product story. 

Search technology and behavior is shifting from rigid questioning ‘red dress’ - to the intuitive “bright, fun holiday clothes to relax in”. Richer and more detailed product attributes help brands respond to this more context and emotionally driven search.
