# Monthly Retail Round-Up - July 2018

## With lots of interesting highlights in the world of retail this July, Dressipi, the experts in [retail personalisation](https://dressipi.com/retail-personalisation-case-study/), have put together our top stories to keep you up to date.

### 1) Push for Retailers to Become More Sustainable

The [Drapers Sustainability Report](http://guides.drapersonline.com/5922.guide) was released this July and centered around creating a circular business model for fashion. This includes:

* Increasing clothing recycling
* Reducing the industry’s reliance on raw materials, e.g. Cotton 

Rebecca Thomson, Head of Commercial Content, [Drapers](http://digitalissues.drapersonline.com/2018/Jul/060718/index.html) highlighted, *“Fashion is one of the world’s most polluting industries. Its operational model is so unsustainable that profits and margins are likely to be eroded by 2030 as resource costs rise.”* After years of talking about the unsustainability of the fashion industry, and shocking facts, many retailers are now introducing sustainable initiatives to create more circular models.

* Reported in [Vogue](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/asos-sustainable-fashion-training-programme), *“a week on from the company’s pledge to ban cashmere, silk, down and feathers across its entire platform by the end of January 2019, **ASOS** is launching an initiative to educate its designers on sustainability.”*

* **John Lewis** is another retailer who recently introduced a sustainable initiative. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/money-for-old-socks-john-lewis-to-buy-back-clothes-to-cut-waste) explained, *“Customers can arrange through an app to have any unwanted clothing that they bought from John Lewis collected from their home, and they will be paid for each item regardless of its condition.”*

* The **H&M Group** is a leader of sustainability in the fashion industry. Among many other things, they aim to use *“100% recycled or other sustainably sourced materials by 2030”* and aim to collect *“25,000 tonnes of unwanted garments each year through its in-store garment collecting service by 2025.”* ([Drapers Sustainability Report](http://guides.drapersonline.com/5922.guide)).
