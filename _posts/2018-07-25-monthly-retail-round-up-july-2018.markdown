# Monthly Retail Round-Up - July 2018

### 1) Push for Retailers to Become More Sustainable

The [Drapers Sustainability Report](http://guides.drapersonline.com/5922.guide) was released this July and centered around creating a circular business model for fashion. This includes:

* Increasing clothing recycling
* Reducing the industry’s reliance on raw materials, e.g. Cotton 

Rebecca Thomson, Head of Commercial Content, [Drapers](http://digitalissues.drapersonline.com/2018/Jul/060718/index.html) highlighted, *“Fashion is one of the world’s most polluting industries. Its operational model is so unsustainable that profits and margins are likely to be eroded by 2030 as resource costs rise.”* After years of talking about the unsustainability of the fashion industry, and shocking facts, many retailers are now introducing sustainable initiatives to create more circular models.
