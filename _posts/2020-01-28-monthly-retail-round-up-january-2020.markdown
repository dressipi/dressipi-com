Some of the best articles from the world of retail and its supporting industries.

# Monthly Retail Round-Up - January 2020

## Post-Christmas returns have been a big topic of conversation this month and here’s why, along with other top retail stories.

### 1) January Returns Spike

Returns are a necessary part of online trading, but January is the busiest time of year for returns for many retailers. The first working day after New Year has been dubbed ‘[Takeback Thursday](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50971709)’ as returns of online purchases spike due to shoppers taking back unwanted Christmas presents. The BBC reported that returns on this day were expected to be 72% higher than the average day in December.

A study commissioned by Royal Mail (reported in [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/returns-to-jump-on-takeback-thursday/7038947.article)) found that:
* The average online shopper in the UK sends back an online purchase every month
* 3/5 online shoppers would be unlikely to use a retailer again if they have a difficult returns experience
* 76% of those surveyed said speed of refund is the most important element of the returns process
* 72% of shoppers want clear guidance about which returns labels to use
* 58% of shoppers are more likely to use a retailer if they offer a “try before you buy” service

Dressipi’s Co-Founder and Chief Data Scientist were interviewed by [BBC Radio 5 Live](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000cpzp) (18 mins 22 seconds in) to help explain some of these ways retailers can better use their data to reduce returns costs. 

### 2) ASOS Rolls Out AR Tool

Back in [March 2018](https://dressipi.com/blog/monthly-retail-round-up-march-2018/), ASOS trialled an augmented reality tool in partnership with [Zeekit](https://zeekit.me/). The technology gave customers a view of a product in different sizes on up to 4 different models. This has now rolled out on up to 16 different models from a whole range of body types. 

Reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/asos-trials-augmented-reality-see-my-fit-tool/2020011547038), *“the aim of the AR tool is to help Asos customers make more informed purchasing decisions as it shows how products look on models that more closely reflect individual customers”.*

Tim Carey, Senior Content Manager, ASOS Studios, said in a statement (reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/asos-trials-augmented-reality-see-my-fit-tool/2020011547038)), *“With this trial of See My Fit, we’re using the latest in AR technology to put the power in our customers’ hands, so they can choose to view a dress on the model that they most identify with, in a way that wouldn’t be possible using traditional model-shooting techniques.”*

### 3) Zalando x Global Fashion Agenda

Sustainability is a buzzword on everyone’s lips at the moment especially for German pureplay retailer, Zalando. Their ‘do.More’ sustainability strategy has announced many new initiatives including [launching reusable packaging](https://dressipi.com/blog/monthly-retail-round-up-september-2019/).

As another part of this strategy, they are now the latest brand to partner with the [Global Fashion Agenda](https://globalfashionagenda.com/), a leadership forum for industry collaboration on fashion sustainability ([Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/zalando-partners-with-global-fashion-agenda-in-sustainability-push/2020011547048)).

Eva Kruse, CEO, Global Fashion Agenda, said (reported in [Fashion United](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/zalando-partners-with-global-fashion-agenda-in-sustainability-push/2020011547048)), *“Global Fashion Agenda is driven by a collaborative and solutions-driven approach to identify the major challenges facing our planet and industry, as well as the opportunities and innovations that can transform the fashion business.”*
