# Monthly Retail Round-Up - February 2018

## February has been a busy month, bringing a number of fashion weeks for A/W 2018 and lots of other retail news. Here are the top stories to keep you up to date.


## 1) Farfetch teams up with Chanel and Burberry

Farfetch was popular in retail news this February with two big headlines announcing partnerships with Chanel and Burberry.

According to [Glossy](http://www.glossy.co/evolution-of-luxury/burberrys-partnership-with-farfetch-will-accelerate-its-see-now-buy-now-business-model), Burberry *“is picking up the pace of its see-now-buy-now business model”*. The partnership with Farfetch will result in Burberry’s “entire global inventory to be available through an e-commerce platform”. This will allow for global distribution, giving the brand access to 150 countries. You can read more about this new collaboration in the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/02/15/burberry-expand-online-reach-farfetch-tie-up/).

Quite different is Farfetch’s strategic partnership with Chanel. They have no plans to sell any of their inventory through Farfetch, with Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion emphasising, *“We are not starting to sell Chanel on the Farfetch marketplace - I want to be very clear on that. Our position on eCommerce is the same. We want to connect our customers with our product and our boutiques are the best way to do so. We strongly believe that digital will never replace the feeling of being in a fitting room and trying on Chanel piece.”*

So what does this partnership involve? [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7029147.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1dNMU1tVTVZall6TnpNMiIsInQiOiJyanV6T3E3VWVNZG10TEVLd2UzM0JIUll4Q2NoQ0xrVVRwZkJXSXd4WnkzeUllRzNDcFdVKytIdWR6bVdXemx0ZklUQmN2WUllSEVoV0p1a1ZDTDRkTWdWeHRzeEZpaytYOUJoeVg0NVJOWXV2VHZkM0JodVNYalJHMzJVUkRZWSJ9) suggests that Chanel wants to create an *“ultra-personalised”* experience within its stores and will work with Farfetch to develop a range of digital initiatives, using Farfetch’s digital know-how to give staff insights on customer’s preferences. This falls in line with Farfetch’s mission, quoted by founder and CEO José Neves as *“To reinvent the luxury shopping experience online as well as offline”*



## 2) Zara launches new online-only store

Zara continues to surge ahead as a leader in retail as it opens its new online-only store in London. As [reported by Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/zara-to-launch-first-online-only-store-in-london/7028764.article?blocktitle=Latest-News&contentID=15719), the Westfield Stratford City store *‘will offer a small edit of women’s and men’s clothing for online purchase directly in store, as well as access to the retailer’s full catalogue online’*. Store staff will also play a crucial role, assisting customers with mobile devices.

Trialling technologies is nothing new for the Spanish giant as they continually experiment with different store concepts to merge online and offline experiences. New mirror, RFID and scanning technology coupled with product recommendation systems highlight the importance of, and increasing demand for, access to personalisation services whilst shopping.

Chairman and CEO of Inditex, Pablo Isla has called it *“another milestone in our strategy of integrating our stores with the online world, which defines our identity as a business”*. 

Dressipi’s Style Director, Natalie Theo recently wrote a [blog post on Zara’s self-checkout stations](https://dressipi.com/blog/zaras-self-service-check-out-highlights-a-stronger-focus-on-creating-better-in-store-customer-experiences/), once again, displaying Zara’s desire to be seen as a leader in creating seamless in-store experiences that are relevant and enjoyable for customers.


## 3) Asos profits rise, but can they ever beat Amazon?

[The Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/asos-uk-revival-shows-online-retailers-escaped-store-gloom) reported on Asos Plc’s recently published results. Sales in the UK (Asos’s largest market) rose 23% to £300.9 million in the four months ended December 31st.

BoF stated that Asos *‘profited at the expense of its store-based rivals’*, emphasising the growing influence of pureplays, and the increasing need for bricks and mortar retailers to step up their in-store offering if they are to differentiate themselves. 

But even Asos are trying to find ways to defend themselves against the likes of Amazon, who continue to innovate, introducing services such as same-day delivery. According to the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/795935ac-0205-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5), Amazon are *‘set to overtake Macy’s to be the largest seller of clothing to Americans this year’*. Analysts Nomura estimate that ‘apparel could be a $45bn-$85bn business for Amazon by 2020’.  These statistics are a very real threat as they make fashion their top priority.

If the likes of Asos are taking measures to differentiate themselves, then bricks and mortar retailers should even more so. A recent article by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/fashion-is-getting-personal-as-brands-battle-for-shoppers.html) states that brands are in a constant battle for claiming a greater share of customer spend, *‘Retailers are finding their websites must mimic some of the same experiences that could be offered in a physical store, bringing the same level of expertise that an associate would give in helping a customer make a selection’*.



## 4) WIRED’s six ways that new technology will revolutionise shopping

With constant reports of store closures ([896 high street shops closed in 2016](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer)) and declining footfall, [WIRED](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer) is adamant that *‘Retailers must combine emotion with innovation if they want to survive growing consumer demand and economic pressure’*.

The article puts an emphasis on re-thinking personal assistance using AI, as well as improving payment methods. You can find another really interesting article [here](https://www.kamcity.com/namnews/uk-and-ireland/supermarkets/amazon-go-tech-will-bring-new-era-personalised-shopping-wont-kill-human-interaction/) by KamCity on how despite the launch of new check-out free technology (Amazon Go), human interaction is still very important and will be used to *‘complement and enhance the relationships customers have with human sales staff’*. 

The WIRED article also comments on how luxury retailers must think more strategically about extending conversations they have with their customers in-store into *‘after-sales care and analytics*’.
