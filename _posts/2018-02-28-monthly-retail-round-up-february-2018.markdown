# Monthly Retail Round-Up - February 2018

## February has been a busy month, bringing a number of fashion weeks for A/W 2018 and lots of other retail news. Here are the top stories to keep you up to date.


## 1) Farfetch teams up with Chanel and Burberry

Farfetch was popular in retail news this February with two big headlines announcing partnerships with Chanel and Burberry.

According to [Glossy](http://www.glossy.co/evolution-of-luxury/burberrys-partnership-with-farfetch-will-accelerate-its-see-now-buy-now-business-model), Burberry *'is picking up the pace of its see-now-buy-now business model'*. The partnership with Farfetch will result in Burberry’s 'entire global inventory to be available through an e-commerce platform'. This will allow for global distribution, giving the brand access to 150 countries. You can read more about this new collaboration in the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/02/15/burberry-expand-online-reach-farfetch-tie-up/).

Quite different is Farfetch’s strategic partnership with Chanel. They have no plans to sell any of their inventory through Farfetch, with Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion emphasising, *“We are not starting to sell Chanel on the Farfetch marketplace - I want to be very clear on that. Our position on eCommerce is the same. We want to connect our customers with our product and our boutiques are the best way to do so. We strongly believe that digital will never replace the feeling of being in a fitting room and trying on Chanel piece.”*

So what does this partnership involve? [Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/7029147.article?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=DR_EditorialNewsletters.Reg:%20Send%20-%20Daily%20News&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1dNMU1tVTVZall6TnpNMiIsInQiOiJyanV6T3E3VWVNZG10TEVLd2UzM0JIUll4Q2NoQ0xrVVRwZkJXSXd4WnkzeUllRzNDcFdVKytIdWR6bVdXemx0ZklUQmN2WUllSEVoV0p1a1ZDTDRkTWdWeHRzeEZpaytYOUJoeVg0NVJOWXV2VHZkM0JodVNYalJHMzJVUkRZWSJ9) suggests that Chanel wants to create an *'ultra-personalised'* experience within its stores. It will work with Farfetch to develop a range of digital initiatives and use Farfetch’s digital know-how to give staff insights on customer’s preferences. This falls in line with Farfetch’s mission, quoted by founder and CEO José Neves as *“To reinvent the luxury shopping experience online as well as offline.”*


## 2) Mango to launch digital fitting rooms

Mango has taken a step towards improving their in-store experience by announcing a partnership with Vodafone, rolling out new digital fitting rooms which will feature smart mirrors. 

[Drapers](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/mango-to-launch-digital-fitting-rooms/7029101.article) reported that the new functionality which is part of the brand’s *'digital transformation project'* will allow shoppers to scan clothes tags and contact store staff to request different sizes and colours of items. The mirror will also recommend additional clothes to complete outfits.

Mango Chief Client Officer Guillermo Corominas said, *“This is a really exciting project for Mango. We see the future of retailing as a blend of the online and the offline.“These new fitting rooms are another step in the digital transformation of our stores to create a whole new experience for our customers.*

This is yet another firm signal that retailers must keep innovating if they are to stay ahead of the game and keep up with customer demand and expectations.


## 3) Internet Retailing Publish 2018 Top500 Report

Internet Retailing released their Top500 Report this February. This report isn’t solely based on revenue, store networks or website traffic but also on six Performance Dimensions, including ‘Strategy and Innovation’, ‘The Customer’, ‘Operations and Logistics’, ‘Merchandising’, ‘Brand Engagement’ and ‘Mobile and Cross-channel’. 

BoF stated that Asos *‘profited at the expense of its store-based rivals’*, emphasising the growing influence of pureplays, and the increasing need for bricks and mortar retailers to step up their in-store offering if they are to differentiate themselves. 

But even Asos are trying to find ways to defend themselves against the likes of Amazon, who continue to innovate, introducing services such as same-day delivery. According to the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/795935ac-0205-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5), Amazon are *‘set to overtake Macy’s to be the largest seller of clothing to Americans this year’*. Analysts Nomura estimate that ‘apparel could be a $45bn-$85bn business for Amazon by 2020’.  These statistics are a very real threat as they make fashion their top priority.

If the likes of Asos are taking measures to differentiate themselves, then bricks and mortar retailers should even more so. A recent article by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/fashion-is-getting-personal-as-brands-battle-for-shoppers.html) states that brands are in a constant battle for claiming a greater share of customer spend, *‘Retailers are finding their websites must mimic some of the same experiences that could be offered in a physical store, bringing the same level of expertise that an associate would give in helping a customer make a selection’*.



## 4) WIRED’s six ways that new technology will revolutionise shopping

With constant reports of store closures ([896 high street shops closed in 2016](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer)) and declining footfall, [WIRED](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-learnings-future-retail-consumer) is adamant that *‘Retailers must combine emotion with innovation if they want to survive growing consumer demand and economic pressure’*.

The article puts an emphasis on re-thinking personal assistance using AI, as well as improving payment methods. You can find another really interesting article [here](https://www.kamcity.com/namnews/uk-and-ireland/supermarkets/amazon-go-tech-will-bring-new-era-personalised-shopping-wont-kill-human-interaction/) by KamCity on how despite the launch of new check-out free technology (Amazon Go), human interaction is still very important and will be used to *‘complement and enhance the relationships customers have with human sales staff’*. 

The WIRED article also comments on how luxury retailers must think more strategically about extending conversations they have with their customers in-store into *‘after-sales care and analytics*’.
