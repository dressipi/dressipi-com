# Monthly Retail Round-Up - December 2018

## It’s been a busy year for the retail industry and December has been no different. Here are the final stories to round it off!

### 1) Farfetch Launches ‘See It, Snap It, Shop It’

Luxury e-commerce platform, Farfetch has partnered with [Syte](https://www.syte.ai/) to launch a visual search feature called See It, Snap It, Shop It. Reported in [Glossy](https://www.glossy.co/evolution-of-luxury/farfetch-launches-visual-search-feature-as-luxury-plays-digital-catch-up), *“the feature lets customers upload pictures from anywhere, which the app will then analyze and serve up either the specific product or something similar.”* This is done using details such as colour, fit and fabric.

Reported in [Tech Startups](https://techstartups.com/2018/12/07/visual-ai-startup-syte-partners-luxury-fashion-platform-farfetch-launch-new-app-visual-search-feature-ios/), Sara Wood, VP Product, Farfetch said, *“Visual search is the ultimate connection between on and offline inspiration. By allowing our customers to show us what they are interested in we gain a deeper understanding of their needs, are able to inspire them with fashion based on what they are looking for, and enable a more personalised shopping experience.”*

This year has seen a wave of retailers continually investing in innovative technology to help them improve their customer experience. Check out some of our [other retail round-ups](https://dressipi.com/blog/) for more.
