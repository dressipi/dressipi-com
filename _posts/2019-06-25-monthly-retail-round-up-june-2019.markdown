# Monthly Retail Round-Up - June 2019

## Dressipi, the world’s only [fashion prediction platform](https://dressipi.com/platform/), brings you a round up of the top retail news this June to keep you up to date.

### 1) ASOS’ Virtual Catwalk

ASOS is constantly rolling out new technology to help achieve better customer engagement. For their latest announcement, reported in [Drapers](about:blank), ASOS has *“launched an augmented reality feature on its app, called Virtual Catwalk”. Partnering with the hologram and AR firm, HoloMe “will give [ASOS] customers a different way to view and experience products before making the decision to buy”*.

So how does it work ? Customers can point their smartphone at a flat surface, click the AR button on the product page of 100 new-in ASOS Design products, and models will appear as though they were in front of them, wearing the product. In [March](https://dressipi.com/blog/monthly-retail-round-up-march-2018/) last year, Zara also experimented with AR having models shown through a smartphone while walking around in-store, in window displays and popping up on packages of online purchases.

We’ve been having a lot of fun experimenting with it at Dressipi HQ and can confirm it's pretty good quality! Have a play around with it yourself [here](https://www.asos.com/women/ctas/fashion-online-13/cat/?cid=13509&page=1).

### 2) The Trending Store

From the 3rd to 7th July, Westfield London is launching a pop-up selling clothes which are trending online. Reported in the [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/westfield-trending-store-ai-pop-up-save-the-children-a4154196.html), The Trending Store is *“an AI-powered initiative to entice online shoppers in store while raising money for Save the Children”*.

In partnership with Nextatlas, the machine learning model will track over 400,000 influencers to find out what they are wearing and what is hot that day. Reported in the [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/westfield-trending-store-ai-pop-up-save-the-children-a4154196.html), *“a list of trending items will then be given to a team of Westfield stylists, who’ll hunt out corresponding items (both clothing and accessories) from across the entire shopping centre each morning, ready to drop in the pop-up.” *

The Trending Store will stock the top 100 items of men’s and women’s clothing and accessories that are trending online that day, catering for all budgets. Reported in [Retail Systems](http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Westfield_Nextatlas_Trending_Store_AI_Fashion.php), stylists will also *“be on hand to help customers pick out key items to suit their own individual styles”.*

### 3) Small Online Businesses Given a Chance on the High Street

Reported in [Retail Systems](http://www.retail-systems.com/rs/Amazon_Clicks_and_Mortar_Pop_Up_Store_Launch.php), *“Amazon and Enterprise Nation have announced the launch of Clicks and Mortar - a new programme to help small businesses grow, both in-store and online.”*

The programme will give around 100 small online businesses the opportunity to have a presence on the high-street in the form of pop-up stores. These 10 pop-ups will be open for a year, occupied for varying lengths of time and *“will explore a new model to help up-and-coming online brands grow their physical presence.”*

George MacDonald, Executive Editor, Retail Week, gave his opinion in [Retail Week](https://www.retail-week.com/property/opinion-amazon-could-be-source-of-new-ideas-on-retail-property/7032078.article?authent=1), *“For some of the retailers, it makes sense only to have a physical presence at particular times of year, such as seasonal peaks, or to run specific brand-building initiatives.”* It also allows online brands to gain recognition and reach customers on the high street that may not have heard of them before.
