Stuart Rose, Chairman, Dressipi.

At Dressipi we are holding a new series of webinars looking at how data and technology can help to solve some of fashion retailers’ biggest problems. Our first webinar focused on the issue of overstocked products. Stuart highlighted just how different the world of retail is as we come out of lockdown and stressed that it is now essential for retailers to optimise processes.

Due to store closures as a result of COVID-19, the overstocked product issue is particularly pertinent. However, regardless of COVID, every season’s requirement to shift clearance stock eats into retailers’ cash/profit.
