  - title: 1-to-1 Personalisation
    body: Our machine learning technology continuously evaluates the performance of
      our recommendations to select the most effective algorithms for each customer
      at every given time, considering their individual profile, preferences, behaviour
      and the context in which they are shopping.
  - title: Continual Learning
    body: Each individual customer has their own model which continually learns and
      evolves with their lifestyle, fashion requirements, activity, purchase and preference
      data – we call this the Fashion Fingerprint®.
  - title: Proven Results
    body: In A/B tests Dressipi has consistently proven to deliver 5-8% increase in
      net incremental revenue per visitor, over and above gains from any competitive
      solution. Take a look at our [Case Studies](https://dressipi.com/resources/case-studies/).
  - title: Specific Fashion Domain Knowledge
    body: We understand that fashion and how customers think of fashion changes with
      time, inspiration and context. Our algorithms take account of fashion specific
      information, updated by some of the industry’s most renowned stylists. We believe
      this represents a key differentiator and enables us to outperform competitors
      when compared with a general approach to personalisation.
  - title: Future Proof Your Business
    body: Adaptability is key. There are many exciting advances in both Machine Learning
      and AI. Our solution marries the best of algorithms and proprietary techniques
      that we constantly evolve by integrating newly discovered methods. You can integrate
      our recommendations into any application or solution using our APIs.
  - title: Personalisation at Every Point of the Shopping Journey
    body: Our solution works across all channels enabling all customers to get the
      best advice and guidance wherever and however they choose to shop - online,
      on mobile or instore.
