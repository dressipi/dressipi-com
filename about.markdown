  handle: intro
  width: narrow
  body: "> Dressipi's mission is to accelerate leading fashion retailers to be truly
    predictive and give their  customers the best possible experience. \n\nLeaders
    in personalisation such as Netflix and Spotify have raised the bar in terms of
    relevancy and experience, but what about fashion? Consumer’s expectations and
    the relationships they have with brands are changing rapidly, and retailers need
    to keep up. \n\nWith technology developed by one of the most talented teams of
    technologists, data scientists and stylists, Dressipi was built to solve fashion
    prediction which is one of the most complex categories.\n\n Innovation and adaptability
    are key. Our solution is an ensemble of algorithms that we constantly evolve by
    integrating newly discovered methods along with our proprietary algorithms. This
    future-proofs a retailer’s personalisation roadmap and reflects how fashion and
    customer requirements evolve over time. "
