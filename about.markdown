    and retailers need to keep up. \n\nWith technology developed by one of the most
    talented teams of technologists, data scientists and stylists, Dressipi's mission
    is to build a solution that solves fashion prediction which is one of the most
    complex categories. \n\nInnovation and adaptability are key. Dressipi's solution
    is an ensemble of algorithms that constantly evolve and integrate newly discovered
    methods along with proprietary algorithms. This future-proofs a retailer’s personalisation
