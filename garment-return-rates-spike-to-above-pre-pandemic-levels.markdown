### But, the good news is we can see what’s coming. 

## Introduction

As we identified in January’s blog, [return rates for clothing dropped significantly over the course of the pandemic](https://dressipi.com/blog/reduced-return-rates-a-bonus-for-fashion-retailers/). This was attributed to two main factors, the change in the mix of purchases from different categories (fewer dresses, more leggings and tracksuit bottoms) and changes in returns rates within each category (more casual wear and less trend, work and occasion wear). 

Now, as lockdowns are easing, consumer purchasing habits suggest a resurgence of excitement to go out and look good. So much so that retailers are beginning to see return rates reaching their pre-pandemic levels, and even in some cases, exceeding those rates. In fact, over May and June, return rates are up 9.1% on 2020 and 4.9% on 2019 (something we also predicted in our January blog!).

Customer basket behaviours and category mix aligns well with restrictions being imposed and lifted. The benefit of this means that going forward, depending on the status of various restrictions, it should be relatively easy to predict return rates ahead of time. 

## What happened over lockdown

### 1) Casualisation of Fashion

Data from throughout the lockdown period suggests a permanent casualisation of fashion. Consumers got used to being at home and with that came habits of more comfortable and informal clothing. There were more purchases of t-shirts, basic tops and jeans alongside decreases in purchases of dresses - particularly event and occasion dresses - and work attire.
