## A reminder of what you will learn in the webinar:

1) How to review your own data to have **a clear view of what is actually increasing return rates** (what % is due to sizing, style, specific product or image issues)

2) How to **build correct return segments on a per-customer basis** and the appropriate action to tackle this (serial returners, profitable returners, etc)

3) How to **build models on a per garment and per-product basis** to better predict return rates and influence sell-through rates in real time

4) Where you should be **focusing your efforts and resources** to tackle returns
