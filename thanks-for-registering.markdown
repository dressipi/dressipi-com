## Returns Webinar: Using Your Data to Uncover the Real Reasons for Returns

1) How to review your own data to have a clear view of what is actually increasing return rates (what % is due to sizing, style, specific product or image issues)

2) How to build correct return segments on a per-customer basis and the appropriate action to tackle this (serial returners, profitable returners, etc)

4) Where you should be focusing your efforts and resources to tackle returns
