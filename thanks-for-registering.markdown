    Returns.'
  body: |-
    1) How to review your own data to have a clear view of what is actually increasing return rates (what % is due to sizing, style, specific product or image issues)
    2) How to build correct return segments on a per-customer basis and the appropriate action to tackle this (serial returners, profitable returners, etc)
    3) How to build models on a per garment and per-product basis to better predict return rates and influence sell-through rates in real-time
    4) Where you should be focusing your efforts and resources to tackle returns
