    body: "River Island is one of the UK’s leading fashion retailers. Generating millions of pounds of annual revenue, the brand boasts over 350 stores worldwide and six dedicated online sites operating in four currencies. 
    \n\n
    River Island believed that personalisation could make a difference to their customer experiences and in turn, their online revenue. Despite this, they were struggling to see any material difference with the two generic personalisation providers they were using. 
    \n\n
    They wanted to explore other options.

    body: "River Island were intrigued by Dressipi’s fashion focussed approach and understood that a fashion focus vs a generic approach was likely to provide a much better experience to customers.
    \n\n
    The team wanted to test Dressipi’s personalisation in a very simple, light touch way and so decided to start with personalisation on the womenswear Product Listing Page (PLP). 
    \n\n
    The team at River Island didn’t consider it could make such a big difference. The initial results surprised - Dressipi outperformed the 2 other generic providers with a 3% increase in revenue per visitor."
