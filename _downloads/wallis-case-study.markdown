The Challenge Wallis was looking for an innovative solution that provided 
their customers with a service both online and in-store that 
gave them the confidence to shop for products that suited 
their lifestyles, flattered their figures and complemented 
their wardrobe. 
“Providing delightful, personalised customer experiences across 
all channels and helping our customers find key pieces for their 
wardrobe that fit perfectly with their lifestyle is a strategy which 
has always been at the heart of the Wallis brand.” Beverley 
Imrie, Wallis
Providing engaging content and style advice that was 
relevant to each customer on an individual level was 
crucial, as well as ensuring a seamless experience that 
benefited the customer as well as the business.
How Dressipi helped Dressipi helps Wallis be truly predictive, enabling them to 
deliver a completely personalised service to its customers. 
Dressipi’s Fashion Prediction Platform makes it easy for 
Wallis to give each customer their own personalised 
shopping journey by predicting which products, outfits and 
sizes the customer would like to see in real time across 
every channel, giving the best possible shopping and 
dressing experience.
Dressipi combines large data sets on the customer and 
garments with machine learning and AI technology to help 
customers make better shopping and dressing decisions. 
Unlike other personalisation solutions every product 
recommended is mapped to each customer as if curated by 
their own personal stylist. Dressipi does this by analysing a 
customer’s profile, behavioural activity, wardrobe context, 
trend sentiment and intent.
“The Online Personal Stylist service is exactly what our customers 
wanted - not only does it help them find the products they want 
quicker, but it also provides inspiration and confidence to try 
something new.” Beverley Imrie, Wallis

Ease of implementation Dressipi are passionate about working with clients closely 
to help them achieve their business goals and deliver 
personalisation that fits perfectly with the brand.
“The team at Dressipi are great to work with - they listen to our 
needs as a business whilst continually innovating their product 
offering.” Beverley Imrie, Wallis
Dressipi’s open Fashion Prediction Platform wraps around 
a retailer’s existing infrastructure to improve ROI from all 
platforms. Implementation takes 6-8 weeks and Dressipi 
provides a high level of support to all its clients, ensuring 
they get to see the benefits of the solution on an ongoing 
basis. 
Results After extensive analysis to understand the true impact of 
the service, Dressipi is now delivering significant overall 
incremental revenue gains to Wallis. There have been 
double-digit increases in order frequency and conversion 
rates for those customers who have created an Online 
Personal Stylist profile.
“Having personalisation technology within your business is a 
must in today’s retail environment. Dressipi have helped us 
achieve that.” Beverley Imrie, Wallis
