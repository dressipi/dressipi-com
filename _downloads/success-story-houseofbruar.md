    class: challenge
    subtitle: 
    body: With a vast product catalogue across a broad customer base, House of Bruar
      were keen to see whether personalisation could increase revenues by putting
      better products in front of each customer. With a large cohort of female shoppers,
      House of Bruar were also interested in a solution that could reduce return rates.
  - title: Objectives
    class: solution
    body: 'The partnership started by AB testing Dressipi’s fashion-specific prediction
      models in two areas: Similar Items on the PDP, and Personalised Outfits on the
      PDP. This was tested vs a more generic algorithm (not trained on the fashion
      domain) and outfits that were manually created by the team internally.'
