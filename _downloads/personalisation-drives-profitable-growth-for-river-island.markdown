Personalisation Drives Profitable Growth for River Island
A Dressipi Case Study dressipi.com

The Challenge River Island was looking for a partner to help deliver an 
ambitious vision of giving their customers interactive, 
inspirational and personalised experiences at all times. 
They wanted to work with a partner who understood that 
customers consume fashion differently to other categories 
and could evolve beyond basic recommendation carousels 
to deliver experiences that help their customers shop and 
dress with confidence.
How Dressipi Helped Dressipi’s fashion-specific focus delivered a short, medium 
and longer-term roadmap that spoke directly to River 
Island’s internal vision of taking personalisation beyond 
generic segmentation and product recommendation 
carousels to a future of retail that is genuinely all about the 
customer. Dressipi’s unique understanding of the business 
of fashion retail meant that each stage of the roadmap so 
far has driven profitable growth with a strong ROI at the 
contributed margin level.
With the knowledge gained over the past 12 months of 
working with River Island, Dressipi is using its unique 
customer and garment data to drive operational 
efficiencies to reduce return rates and improve sell￾through rates through a deeper relationship with the 
buying and merchandising teams.

Results The initial proof of value with the foundation product 
recommendations outperformed other vendors with a 
+3.2% uplift in revenue per visitor.
The full execution is performing even better. Customers 
who interact with the personalised content are twice as 
likely to convert and we see their AOV increase by an 
average of 20%.
Working with Dressipi “Working with Dressipi is a breath of fresh air. They are 
straight-forward, open, transparent and truly understand 
that fashion is different from other eCommerce categories 
(such as travel, electronics, groceries etc). They have taken 
the time to understand how our business works and the best 
way for River Island to deliver profitable growth.”
