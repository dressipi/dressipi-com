        body: |-
          Fashion behaves completely differently to other industries and, beyond that, customer expectations of the luxury market are different to that of the high street.

          In addition, with a broad customer base across the United Arab Emirates and Europe, providing recommendations was going to be particularly complex with the inclusion of both modest and non-modest dressers. Recommendations had to be suitable depending on the need of each customer.

          The luxury brand was looking for a partner within the fashion domain with which they could deliver the best possible shopping and dressing experience that went beyond the basics to enable a more predictive offering both in terms of the products and outfits a customer sees.

          "“We didn’t want to offer the status quo of basic recommendations. We wanted
          to go beyond that and truly predict what our customers were looking for at an
          individual level. We wanted a partner that went the extra mile, truly understood
          the fashion domain and would work with us to innovate and create unique experiences
          that were in line with our brand DNA. Dressipi delivers on all of this and allows
          us to offer our customers a truly personalized experience, which is a key part
          of our strategy.”"
