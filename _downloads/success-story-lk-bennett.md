    body: |
      LK Bennett is a British affordable luxury brand. Founded in 1990, it quickly became established as a leading fashion house offering complete wardrobe solutions for all occasions, with a vision of bringing “a bit of Bond Street luxury to the High Street”.<br>

      Like many retailers, LK Bennett was focused on good quality daily and weekly reporting. They were looking for a partner that could help them see the bigger picture and monitor changes when both the external environment around them changed and their internal strategies changed.

    class: solution
    body: |
      Using Dressipi’s Data Insight Hub and applying a fashion-specific lens on every product and customer, LK Bennett was able to transform their data into a powerful asset that was genuinely actionable.<br>

      Dressipi and LK Bennett worked together and edited the interactive dashboards to guarantee that they would be right for their specific needs and enhance all operational parts of their business. They could quickly get started by simply adding some tracking onsite. <br>

      The dashboards are used for monthly reporting which has been particularly helpful for tracking top-level strategies for optimisation. With the uncertainty of COVID and being light on data resource, this was key for LK Bennett. <br>

    quote: "“Having data insight that is directly linked to our order management system
      is much more reliable for order and product purchases than Google Analytics.
      The category tracking for products is also helpful as our business categories
      are not built in to all our systems, so out of the box groups allow us to segment
      our catalogue into the categories and subcategories that customer’s shop online,
      for example, ‘Dresses’ & ‘Fit & Flare’.”"

  - title: The Results
    class: results
    body: "The right fashion-specific data, used in the right way, will not only deliver
      revenue growth but will drive additional profit too. LK Bennett was able to
      experience this first hand by viewing the dashboard with customer segments over
      time, allowing the team to easily pinpoint areas for growth.<br>\n\nAs with
      many other fashion retailers, a large proportion of revenue comes from a relatively
      small percentage of visitors. Typically, 60-70% of customers only buy once.
      If you can get a customer to buy a second order or 3rd order they are increasingly
      likely to become regular customers. So that first to second purchase metric
      is critical to ensure healthy growth within a business. <br>\n\nThis has been
      a key metric for LK Bennett with the Dressipi dashboards. The Insight Hub allowed
      them to view the best product category to send at the most optimal time. They
      could then evolve their CRM strategy in line with customer behaviour. The first
      to second purchase metric has improved by an average of 25% for the 4 months
      from December 2020 - March 2021.<br> \n"
