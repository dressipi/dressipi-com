    body: "British affordable luxury brand, LK Bennett had been using their previous
      merchandising tool for about 6 years. It was a powerful tool but they weren't
      getting the full potential out of it as they needed to continuously spend a
      lot of time, money and resource to keep the technology up to date.\n\nAlong
      with keeping on brand, LK Bennett wanted to ensure they were showing their customers
      their best products at the right time. \n\nGrapheneAI powered by Dressipi is
      the tool that can deliver both. "
  - title: Combining the gold standard search and merchandising with the gold standard
      real-time personalization technology
    class: solution
    body: "Traditionally there has been tension between merchandisers and personalization
      because personalization takes away control. The quick fix for apparel retailers
      is to focus on either one or the other but they are both business critical.\n\nMerging
      the two creates powerful merchandising blends where every customer sees their
      best products and merchandisers maintain complete control over their brand strategies.\n\nLK
      Bennett now has a level of automation that means they can step away from the
      categories that they don't have time to get into the nitty gritty with. Whilst
      categories that they want to be super visual and curated (such as ‘New In’)
      can be controlled or personalized easily.\n\nThe biggest impact was being able
      to include a customer’s personalized view in the merchandising blend. \n\nThe
      future of online apparel retail relies on this integration of merchandising
      and personalization to deliver customer loyalty and profit increases."

    quote: "“We now have a tool that is still extremely powerful, but is much lighter
      weight for the team to use in terms of the amount of time they need to invest,
      which is absolutely one of our key objectives. We couldn’t have been more pleased
      with the combination of merchandising and personalization, it really does give
      the best of both worlds where both the retailer and the customer are happy.”"
