  - title: The Challenge
    class: challenge
    body: "Fashion behaves completely differently to other industries and, beyond that, customer expectations of the luxury market are different to that of the high street.


    In addition, with a broad customer base across the United Arab Emirates and Europe, providing recommendations was going to be particularly complex with the inclusion of both modest and non-modest dressers. Recommendations had to be suitable depending on the need of each customer.


    The luxury brand was looking for a partner within the fashion domain with which they could deliver the best possible shopping and dressing experience that went beyond the basics to enable a more predictive offering both in terms of the products and outfits a customer sees."

  - title: The Solution
    class: solution
    body: "Dressipi takes a very different approach to generic recommendation providers so were able to enable each customer to have their own tailored shopping experience throughout their journey based on their individual needs and preferences. 


    Dressipi worked with them to ensure brand DNA and luxury specifics were included in the recommendations. When styling a modest dresser, specific rules enabled layering pieces to be combined with immodest garment features. When styling a non-modest dresser, there were completely different outfit combinations."

    quote: "“We didn’t want to offer the status quo of basic recommendations. We wanted to go beyond that and truly predict what our customers were looking for at an individual level. We wanted a partner that went the extra mile, truly understood the fashion domain and would work with us to innovate and create unique experiences that were in line with our brand DNA. Dressipi delivers on all of this and allows us to offer our customers a truly personalised experience, which is a key part of our strategy.”"
