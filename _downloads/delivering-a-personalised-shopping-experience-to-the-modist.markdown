Delivering a Personalised Shopping Experience to The Modist

The Challenge With a broad customer base across three main continents, 
The Modist has seen impressive growth in the luxury space 
over the past two years. The brand was looking for a 
partner with which they could deliver the best possible 
shopping and dressing experience that went beyond the 
basics to enable a more predictive offering both in terms of 
the products and outfits a customer sees.
“We didn’t want to offer the status quo of basic recommendations. 
We wanted to go beyond that and truly predict what our 
customers were looking for at an individual level. 
We wanted a partner that went the extra mile, truly 
understood the fashion domain and would work with us to 
innovate and create unique experiences that were in line 
with our brand DNA.
Dressipi delivers on all of this and allows us to offer our 
customers a truly personalised experience, which is a key part of 
our strategy.” 
– Lauren
Accessing customer and garment data was also important 
as The Modist look to improve efficiencies throughout all 
key operational areas (buying, merchandising, marketing 
and supply chain).
How Dressipi helped The Modist solution enables each customer to have their 
own tailored shopping experience throughout their journey 
based on their individual needs and preferences. This is 
particularly complex as The Modist’s customer base 
includes modest and non-modest dressers, therefore 
recommendations must be suitable depending on the need 
of each customer.

Phase 1 of the partnership was to understand the value 
Dressipi’s entry-level fashion-specific prediction scores 
delivered vs the incumbent recommendation provider which 
delivered very compelling results (see below an example of 
Dressipi personalised recommendations for each individual 
visitor ‘You May Also Like’ indicated by the pink bars).
Phase 2 will offer greater relevancy throughout the whole 
journey as well as a starting to use the Dressipi data to drive 
greater insights and efficiencies throughout the business.

Ease of Implementation One of the benefits of working with Dressipi is the ease of 
getting the initial phase up and running and the high level of 
support dedicated throughout. This ensures clients get to 
see the benefits of the solution on an ongoing basis.
“The service was very easy to implement. A light-touch approach 
(around 4 to 5 days of effort on our side) meant Phase 1 was 
launched quickly to demonstrate the value. The team at Dressipi 
are great to work with. They always go beyond the call of duty to 
deliver the best possible service.”
