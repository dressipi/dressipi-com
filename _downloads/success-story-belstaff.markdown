    subtitle: 
    body: "From its historic inception in 1924, Belstaff has become one of the UK’s
      leading names in luxury apparel and footwear, with an iconic identity tied to
      classic British motorsports. Their timeless elegance is driven, behind the scenes,
      by innovation and forward thinking, which has secured their place in luxury
      fashion retail.\n\nWith ecommerce driving an increasingly significant proportion
      of sales, Belstaff wanted to expand their customer-centric approach across all
      shopping channels. \n\nDressipi could help deliver this.\n"

    class: solution
    body: |
      After launching personalized product and outfit recommendations on both the homepage and PDP, Belstaff had seen how Dressipi’s recommendation API’s could help them to implement a truly exceptional shopping experience. The next step was for Belstaff to start testing Dressipi’s personalized emails.

      The luxury apparel retailer recognised the value in moving away from outdated and often counterproductive ‘batch and blast’. So, by simply injecting Dressipi’s API’s into their existing ESP, they created truly personalized emails that engage and inspire their customers.

      Dressipi and Belstaff worked closely together to ensure that the iconic Belstaff brand DNA was understood and captured in Dressipi’s algorithms. Brand DNA is especially essential for luxury retailers so it was important that the recommendations in the emails integrate seamlessly with Belstaff’s look and feel.

      Belstaff ran a 4 week test to prove the incremental value from utilising the Dressipi tool in emails with 50% of customers seeing Dressipi recommended products and the other 50% non-personalized.

      The potential value gain was evident. Across all KPIs, the emails that featured Dressipi recommendations outperformed those that did not. Click-To-Open Rate was up by 14%, Revenue was up 69%, Conversion was 32% higher and Total Orders were 63% higher than the non-personalized emails.
