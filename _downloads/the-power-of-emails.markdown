70% of a retailer’s revenue typically comes from their top 20-30% customers. Given how much retailers know about these customers, it’s crazy that they typically all get the same message. Blanket emails die in the noise, making retailers lose customers and revenues suffer. With customers demanding more and more everyday, even segmentation is not good enough if you want your brand to stay ahead. 

Truly personalized emails can be your secret weapon particularly with the need to maximize digital capabilities due to COVID. What’s more, retention marketing is more cost effective for retailers than acquisition marketing so in a time when cash is tight, getting your customers to come back and buy again is a quick, easy win. 

Done well, personalized emails should be delivering an additional 6-10% of incremental revenue to your brand by enhancing the customer experience.
