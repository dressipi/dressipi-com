  - title: The online shopping journey created friction for customers
    class: challenge
    subtitle: 
    body: "John Lewis & Partners is a leading high-end, department store with a large
      online presence and a number of retail stores operating across Great Britain.
      Fashion has always been a core area of focus for them.\n\nJohn Lewis wanted
      to remove the friction from their online shopping journeys and create truly
      tailored one to one experiences for their frequent and loyal customers. They
      understood that styling and outfitting was really important when selling fashion
      and were looking for a solution that could deliver personalized outfits at scale,
      across womenswear, menswear and kidswear. \n\nDressipi was the only vendor who
      could deliver this. \n"

    subtitle: 
    class: solution
    body: "Working with Dressipi, John Lewis looked at how they could further optimize
      customers' existing core journeys and help them make the right purchase decisions
      by offering personalized outfits. \n\nDressipi’s focus on fashion and attribute
      tagging allows John Lewis to display multiple outfits per garment and by occasion
      whether that be ‘Casual’, ‘Creative Work’ or ‘Evening’, showing the versatility
      of the garment and inspiring the customer. Completely personalized to each and
      every customer, Dressipi creates up to 100 million outfits per night. No other
      vendor can do this.\n\nWhen styling a John Lewis customer, the fact they are
      a multi brand retailer with a diverse customer group had to be taken into account.
      Younger customers may favour brands such as Mango and will have different ideas
      on what a good evening look consists of compared to an older customer leaning
      towards Hush and L.K.Bennett as their preferred brands. This meant brand adjacency
      and sensitivities about how brands are shown together as well as inspirational
      brand discovery are important elements that have to be built into Dressipi recommendations.\n\nAs
      a brand that spans across womenswear, menswear and kidswear, another key consideration
      were the differences between the sectors. For example, with kidswear you need
      to be less worried in terms of outfitting but you need to show the versatility
      of the garment so the customer knows they are getting the value for money. It
      is especially hard because kids grow up very fast so knowing it is more about
      the age of the child rather than the shape. With men, they are much more consistent
      when they buy clothes, outfits for them are about discoverability. Dressipi’s
      algorithms were able to cater to these hurdles.\n\nAnother part of the John
      Lewis and Dressipi journey was the creation of a customer profile. Dressipi
      can provide personalization for everyone but John Lewis chose to go a step further
      and to allow their customers to create a profile to get an even richer customer
      experience. It allows their customers to have their own personal style page
      with a place to view their outfits and recommendations.\n"

    body: John Lewis saw an uplift in revenue per email sent when responding with
      personalized strategies overall. This was particularly notable with the most
      recent test on the outfit recommendations seeing a significant increase in revenue.
    quote: "“Working with Dressipi has really helped us look at different ways in
      how we can support our customers on the site and the different tactics that
      we can deploy to meet their needs. We are aspiring towards having the ability
      to influence customers and help facilitate their shopping journey from the point
      they arrive on the website all the way through to post checkout and then even
      beyond that with a follow up email as well. We are also looking at having a
      better understanding of the data we have on customers and how we can help tie
      that back into a more personalized journey.”"
