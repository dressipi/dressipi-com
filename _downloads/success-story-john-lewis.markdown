    body: "John Lewis & Partners is a leading high-end, department store with a large
      online presence and a number of retail stores operating across Great Britain.
      Generating over £3.5 billion in revenue across all categories, and over £1 billion
      in fashion alone, they recognised that fashion was a core area of focus. \n\nJohn
      Lewis wanted to remove the friction from their online shopping journeys and
      create truly tailored one to one experiences for their frequent and loyal customers.
      They understood that styling and outfitting was really important when selling
      fashion and were looking for a solution that could deliver personalised outfits
      at scale, across womenswear, menswear and kidswear. \n\nDressipi was the only
      vendor who could deliver this. \n"

    class: solution
    body: "Working with Dressipi, John Lewis looked at how they could further optimise
      customers' existing core journeys and help them make the right purchase decisions
      by offering personalised outfits. \n\nDressipi’s focus on fashion and attribute
      tagging allows John Lewis to display multiple outfits per garment and by occasion
      whether that be ‘Casual’, ‘Creative Work’ or ‘Evening’, showing the versatility
      of the garment and inspiring the customer. Completely personalised to each and
      every customer, Dressipi creates up to 100 million outfits per night. No other
      vendor can do this.\n\nWhen styling a John Lewis customer, the fact they are
      a multi brand retailer with a diverse customer group had to be taken into account.
      Younger customers may favour brands such as Mango and will have different ideas
      on what a good evening look consists of compared to an older customer leaning
      towards Hush and L.K.Bennett as their preferred brands. This meant brand adjacency
      and sensitivities about how brands are shown together as well as inspirational
      brand discovery are important elements that have to be built into Dressipi recommendations.\n\nAs
      a brand that spans across womenswear, menswear and kidswear, another key consideration
      were the differences between the sectors. For example, with kidswear you need
      to be less worried in terms of outfitting but you need to show the versatility
      of the garment so the customer knows they are getting the value for money. It
      is especially hard because kids grow up very fast so knowing it is more about
      the age of the child rather than the shape. With men, they are much more consistent
      when they buy clothes, outfits for them are about discoverability. Dressipi’s
      algorithms were able to cater to these hurdles.\n\nAnother part of the John
      Lewis and Dressipi journey was the creation of a customer profile. Dressipi
      can provide personalisation for everyone but John Lewis chose to go a step further
      and to allow their customers to create a profile to get an even richer customer
      experience. It allows their customers to have their own personal style page
      with a place to view their outfits and recommendations.\n"
