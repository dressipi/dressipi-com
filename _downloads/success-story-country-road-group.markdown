    subtitle: 
    body: "Country Road Group is one of Australia's largest specialty fashion retailers
      with over AUD $1bn in revenue across their five iconic brands - Country Road,
      Mimco, Trenery, Witchery and Politix. \n\nTheir aim was to deliver the best
      experience to their customers so they started searching for a company that could
      help them make a step-change in personalization and stay competitive.\n\nDressipi
      could deliver this, personalizing to every individual."
  - title: Style inspiration across the customer journey
    subtitle: 
    class: solution
    body: "Country Road Group started by testing improved personalization on their
      Witchery website. \n\nFirst, they used Dressipi to improve their product tagging.
      Rather than their original 7 attributes per garment, they were able to automatically
      tag each product with up to 50 attributes. With this depth of data in place,
      they were in a great position to improve the product discovery experience.\n\nUsing
      Dressipi, they launched personalized outfits and similar item recommendations
      on the Product Detail Page (PDP). The outfits are displayed by occasion (work,
      casual, evening and occasion), showing the versatility of each garment and giving
      the customer style inspiration. \n\nThey also launched personalized weekly emails
      to drive more revenue and continually build an understanding of their visitors
      at every step of the journey. The aim is to make sure their customers' shopping
      experiences get better and better.\n"

      Witchery saw an increase of 4% in Revenue per Visitor using Dressipi’s similar items and personalized outfits vs their incumbent provider.

      The personalized emails saw a revenue per email increase of 11% against Witchery’s BAU emails. They are now looking to launch post-purchase emails to show customers what to wear with items they recently bought in a way that works perfectly for them.

      After the success of Witchery, Country Road Group is rolling out Dressipi’s personalized recommendations and outfits for all sister brands.
