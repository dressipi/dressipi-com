    body: "Country Road Group is one of Australia's largest specialty fashion retailers
      with over AU$1bn in revenue across their five iconic brands - Country Road,
      Mimco, Trenery, Witchery and Politix. \n\nTheir aim was to deliver the best
      experience to their customers so they started searching for a company that could
      help them make a step-change in personalization and stay competitive.\n\nDressipi
      could deliver this, personalizing to every individual."

    subtitle: 
    class: solution
    body: "Country Road Group started by testing improved personalization on their
      Witchery website. \n\nFirst, they used Dressipi to improve their product tagging.
      Rather than their original 7 attributes per garment, they were able to automatically
      tag each product with up to 50 attributes. With this depth of data in place,
      they were in a great position to improve the product discovery experience.\n\nUsing
      Dressipi, they launched personalized outfits and similar item recommendations
      on the Product Display Page (PDP). The outfits are displayed by occasion (work,
      casual, evening and occasion), showing the versatility of each garment and giving
      the customer style inspiration. \n\nThey also launched personalized weekly emails
      to drive more revenue and continually build an understanding of their visitors
      at every step of the journey. The aim is to make sure their customers' shopping
      experiences get better and better.\n"

      Given the success of the initial test, River Island were then prepared to extend personalization to all parts of the customer journey and expand across their menswear and kidswear categories.

      Since then the partnership has gone from strength to strength. Rolling out personalized outfits and similar items on the Product Description Page and PLP saw results get better and better increasing revenue from the initial 3% to 6% in just 12 months, increasing AOV by 5% and increasing conversion by 3%.
