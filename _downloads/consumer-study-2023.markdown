# Consumer Study 2023: The State of Personalization

## Dressipi conducted a consumer study of the state of personalization for online fashion retailers in January 2023. The key goals of this study were: 

* To understand whether consumers interact with personalization technologies and where their frustrations lie
* To identify which areas retailers should be focusing their efforts for the best chance of engagement and maximum profit 
* To evaluate the impact that inflation will have on online shopping and how to mitigate its effect
