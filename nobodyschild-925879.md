- author: Rob Hitchman, Digital Product Owner, John Lewis
  quote: "“Working with Dressipi has really helped us look at different ways in how
    we can support our customers on the site and the different tactics that we can
    deploy to meet their needs. \n"
- author: Simon Konn, Director of Insights & CRM, River Island
  quote: "“Being able to use and drive things out from proven product attributes and
    linking them to customers enables you to understand what might work outside of
    their core categories.”\n"
- author: Sally Hunter, Digital Insight Analyst, LK Bennett
  quote: "“The category tracking for products is helpful as our business categories
    are not built in to all our systems, so out of the box groups allow us to segment
    our catalogue into the categories and subcategories that customer’s shop online,
    for example, ‘Dresses’ & ‘Fit & Flare’.”"
