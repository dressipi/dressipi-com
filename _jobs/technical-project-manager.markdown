The world of retail is changing, and Dressipi is leading the charge.
Delivering great customer experiences is the only way for retailers to succeed. Using advanced
machine learning we help some of the UK’s biggest brands to predict what their customers want
to buy and keep so they can truly connect with their shoppers.

### Where you can make an impact

As Technical Project Manager you are responsible for providing technical leadership and
guidance to our clients while they are building their Dressipi integrations.

This is a high-impact, mission-critical role spiking on both technical and business skills.

You are the engineering expert in external client discussions - using your technical acumen and
understanding of priorities to drive high-quality integrations while accelerating time-to-live.

You will also play the role of the client champion in internal engineering discussions, bringing
first-hand knowledge of client issues and needs that will help inform product and feature
strategy.

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of
people, combining the best talents in all disciplines.

We operate at significant scale, but we’re small relative to the opportunity. We have a
staggering amount of work ahead. That means everyone on our team has the chance to both
contribute and evolve in their career.


### You

We are looking for people who have the love and tenacity for solving hard and diverse
problems. You need a keen attention to detail, the ability to clearly identify issues, and the
determination to deliver high quality solutions through to the end.

* Create technical content (sample code, demos, etc.) to show clients how to implement
specific use cases or best practices

* Help improve Dressipi’s products by collecting and communicating customer client
feedback

### Requirements

* Comfortable talking about technical concepts and explaining how Dressipi works, both
from an API architecture and product perspective
* An empathetic, collaborative, communicative, and consultative work style
* Confidence and comfort with clients
* Exceptional verbal and written communication abilities
* Intellectual curiosity, and great problem-solving skills

### Desired

* BSc or MSc in Computer Science, or related subject, or equivalent work experience
* Experience of testing platforms such as Qubit, Monetate, Adobe
* An understanding of AB tests
* Have tinkered with a bunch of languages and services, with enough insight across the
programming landscape to step into unfamiliar code and make sense of what’s going on
* Be able to think on your feet and dive into helping our clients with their technical issues
* Excel at generating excitement around what Dressipi is building within our prospects and
users
* Enjoy the puzzle of solving open-ended problems, both individually and as a member of
our team
* Empathize with users of all experience levels and see through their questions to quickly
grasp the issues they’re facing
* Software engineering experience

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of
people, combining passion and the best talents in all disciplines.

### The Company
Dressipi is the leader in fashion personalisation.

Dressipi was founded by tech entrepreneurs Donna North &amp; Sarah McVittie to solve the problem
of overwhelming choice.

The consumer was underserved, navigating through 1000s of products to find one that matched
their needs. There was a better way to buy clothes.

As Dressipi grew it was obvious this new alternative was also beneficial to retailers – by using
our technology they could be more efficient, more customer centric and better world citizens.

Today, we give fashion retailers the ability to predict what each shopper will buy and not return,
in real time. This also improves matching demand to supply and ultimately reducing wastage.

We use a combination of powerful, fashion specific AI, expert knowledge, proprietary structured
product data and customer profiles to deliver prediction at scale.

Dressipi is backed by a great group of investors and works with many of the largest retailers. Sir
Stuart Rose is our Chairman (Chairman of Ocado and previously CEO and Chairman of Marks
&amp; Spencer plc).

Dressipi was recently named one of Britain’s fastest growing Top Tech firms. Multi award
winning and working on ground-breaking technology which is having a real impact we think we
can offer you something fantastic.
