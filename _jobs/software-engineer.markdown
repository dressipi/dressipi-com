The world of retail is changing, and Dressipi is leading the charge. Delivering great customer experiences is the only way for retailers to succeed. We help some of the UK’s biggest brands to better predict what their customers want to buy and keep so they can truly connect with their shoppers. 

### Where you can make an impact

We are looking for a Software Engineer who has expertise in building and scaling large web applications and who can collaborate closely with Data Scientists, Product Owners and Clients.

Your job will involve working across the entire Dressipi technology stack, developing and deploying the APIs, integrations and hosted content used by our clients and internal teams. You will solve complex challenges involving, for example, the scalability and design constraints of very large data sets. Our team is simultaneously scaling a demanding application while simplifying complex business processes for our clients.

We deeply value our engineering culture. We strongly emphasize trust, mentorship and collaboration and your job also involves elevating your peers by providing feedback, mentoring and improving our working practices.

Your work will directly impact consumers by personalising shopping journeys online and in-store and impact the efficiency of retailers by enabling them to better match demand to supply. 

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of people, combining the best talents in all disciplines.

### Responsibilities

* Maintain and implement new features in our suite of Ruby On Rails web applications

* Work closely with Product owners and clients to flesh out and build solutions for new and existing clients

* Support front end and data science teams by designing and building the APIs and integrations they consume

* Write operational documentation and provide subsequent support and training for team members

* Establish, maintain and suggest good working practices that help the team work effectively

### Requirements

* Minimum of 2 years’ experience as a programmer, designing and scaling web applications and APIs
 
* A command of one or more serverside languages and willingness to get up to speed on our stack (Python, Ruby etc.)

* The ability to quickly pick up new technologies and approaches

* A drive to build scalable and performant applications and APIs

* Experience with "NoSQL" data backends (MongoDB, ElasticSearch)

* The tenacity to solve hard and diverse problems

* An interest in exchanging ideas around building robust, maintainable software

* Great communication skills, whether it be with colleagues or clients

* Comfort providing and receiving feedback on implementation ideas

### Nice to haves

* Great culture: We hire creative, friendly people who never want to stop learning
 
* Employee equity so everyone gets to share in the company’s success

* Never go to work on your birthday again: an extra day off on your birthday

* Regular team lunches & drinks

* Conference budget

* Free fashion advice (if you want it!)
