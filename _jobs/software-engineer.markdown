We're seeking an engineer to join our smallish team building web applications that provide highly personalised product recommendations. You'll be working on projects for some of the most successful high street retailers including Topshop, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, the Shop Direct Group - including a 'retail first' project that is taking personalisation offline into stores. The role is broad, from our outfit creation algorithms to designing multi-region deployment strategies.

### Where you can make an impact

You'll chiefly be working on the apis and backend technology that support these customer facing applications. You'll also be supporting the front end developers who consume these apis - experience with front-end technologies such as JavaScript/ Backbone/React/React-Native is a bonus.

You'll be involved from the earliest stage of a feature: discussing the underlying problem or consumer need with our stylists or product owners before designing a solution and implementing it. The majority of our work takes place on a set of rails apps (currently all on rails 4.2 & ruby 2.2), with data stored in Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB and hosted on AWS, but we are open to expanding our toolchain when needed

### The ideal candidate will have:

* An interest in solving hard and diverse problems

* The will and ability to pick up new technologies as required

* Interest in building web applications capable of servicing millions of users

* Good working knowledge of at least some of the technologies we use

### Sound like you?
