Interested in disrupting the trillion pound retail industry? Weâ€™re tackling one of the hottest and most challenging problems in Machine Learning: building a personalisation system that understands fashion.

### Where you can make an impact

For Dressipi, machine learning is a keystone technology to predict which clothes will look great on a customer, answer questions through Amiya (our chatbot), and process images of products to create metadata.

We are looking for a Software Engineer who has expertise in machine learning programming and can collaborate closely with Data Scientists in implementing state of the art algorithms.

Your job will involve developing and deploying machine learning algorithms for the modelling and analysis of data. Challenges involve very large data sets and design constraints that may arise from, for example, latency requirements. Your work will directly impact end consumers in the form of personalising shopping journeys and communications both in-store and online.

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of people, combining the best talents in all disciplines.


### Responsibilities

* Work closely with Data Science teams to implement and deploy machine learning algorithms

* Collaborate with Engineering teams to integrate experimental capabilities into highly complex production systems

* Apply data-mining, machine learning and/or graph analysis techniques for a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving customers, their relationships and their fashion preferences

* Harness cutting-edge ML tools and libraries to solve problems quickly and efficiently

* Write operational documentation and provide subsequent support and training for team members

### Requirements

* MSc in Computer Science or related subject

* 2 years work experience as a programmer, writing code for production

* Experience implementing Machine Learning algorithms

* One of: C, C++, Java, or similar

* One of: Python, R, Matlab, or similar

* Solid SQL skills

* The tenacity to solve hard and diverse problems

* The ability to quickly pick up new technologies and approaches

* Additionally of benefit are: Ruby, Kaggle competitions, knowledge of recommender systems, Amazon AWS
