Interested in disrupting the trillion pound retail industry? We’re tackling one of the hottest and most challenging problems in Machine Learning: building a personalisation system that understands fashion. 

### Where you can make an impact

For Dressipi, machine learning is a keystone technology to predict which clothes will look great on a customer, answer questions through Amiya (our chatbot), and process images of products to create metadata.
We are looking for a Junior Machine Learning Engineer who is passionate, prepared to learn new skills and can collaborate closely with Engineers and Data Scientists in implementing state of the art algorithms. 
Your job will involve developing and deploying machine learning algorithms for the modelling and analysis of data. Challenges involve very large data sets and design constraints that may arise from, for example, latency requirements. Your work will directly impact end consumers in the form of personalising shopping journeys and communications both instore and online. 
We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of people, combining the best talents in all disciplines. 

### Responsibilities

•	Work closely with Data Science and Engineering teams to implement and deploy machine learning algorithms

•	Collaborate with Engineering teams to integrate experimental capabilities into highly complex production systems

•	Apply data-mining, machine learning and/or graph analysis techniques for a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving customers, their relationships and their fashion preferences

•	Harness cutting-edge ML tools and libraries to solve problems quickly and efficiently

•	Understand and leverage crowdsourcing and human computation approaches to data labeling
