The world of retail is changing, and Dressipi is leading the charge.
Delivering great customer experiences is the only way for retailers to succeed. Using advanced machine learning we help some of the UK’s biggest brands to predict what their customers want to buy and keep so they can truly connect with their shoppers.

### Where you can make an impact

As Solutions Engineer you are responsible for providing technical guidance to our clients while they are building their Dressipi integrations.

This is a high-impact, mission-critical role spiking on both technical and client facing skills.

You are the engineering expert in external client discussions - using your technical acumen and understanding of priorities to drive high-quality integrations while accelerating time-to-live.

You will also play the role of the client champion in internal engineering discussions, bringing first-hand knowledge of client issues and needs that will help inform product and feature strategy.

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of people, combining the best talents in all disciplines.

We operate at significant scale, but we’re small relative to the opportunity. We have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means everyone on our team has the chance to both contribute and evolve in their career.

### You

We are looking for people who have the love and tenacity for solving hard and diverse problems. You need a keen attention to detail, the ability to clearly identify issues, and the determination to deliver high quality solutions through to the end.

### Responsibilities

- Interface directly with our client’s technical teams, serving as their primary technical point of contact during integration

- Understand client requirements and communicate how Dressipi can solve their technical challenges, from high-level architecture to code implementation

- Create technical content (sample code, demos, etc.) to show clients how to implement specific use cases or best practices

- Help improve Dressipi’s products by collecting and communicating customer client feedback

### Requirements

- A strong technical generalist background
- Comfort with code-level debugging (Dressipi code and client code)
- Comfortable talking about technical concepts and explaining how Dressipi works, both from an API, architecture and product perspective
- An empathetic, collaborative, communicative, and consultative work style
- Confidence and comfort with clients
- Exceptional verbal and written communication abilities
- Intellectual curiosity, and great problem-solving skills

### Desired

- BSc or MSc in Computer Science, or related subject, or equivalent work experience
- Experience of testing platforms such as Qubit, Monetate, Adobe
- An understanding of AB tests
- Have tinkered with a bunch of languages and services, with enough insight across the
  programming landscape to step into unfamiliar code and make sense of what’s going on
- Be able to think on your feet and dive into helping our clients with their technical issues
- Excel at generating excitement around what Dressipi is building within our prospects and
  users
- Enjoy the puzzle of solving open-ended problems, both individually and as a member of
  our team
- Empathize with users of all experience levels and see through their questions to quickly
  grasp the issues they’re facing
- Software engineering experience

We are not a traditional tech start-up; it is an exciting environment with a diverse group of
people, combining passion and the best talents in all disciplines.

### The Company
