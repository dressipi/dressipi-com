We're seeking a mid to senior level full stack developer to join our small, agile and highly motivated team building web applications and mobile apps that provide highly personalised product recommendations. You'll be working on projects for some of the most successful high street retailers including Topshop, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, and the Shop Direct Group including a 'retail first' project that is taking personalisation offline into stores.

### Where you can make an impact

You will be working to create new and maintain existing customer-facing applications for our retail partners. You'll be creating semantic, accessible and responsive pages in a Ruby on Rails environment, and have enough Ruby experience to make changes to controllers and to write and fix tests.

You'll get to work closely with stylists, designers, backend and machine learning developers and product owners both in-house and with our clients.

We'll expect you to play a key role in migrating some of our legacy CoffeeScript/Backbone code to ES6/React/Redux. We are committed to a culture of learning and personal development for everyone, so you'll be encouraged to get stuck in with new tools, frameworks and languages and stretch yourself in new areas.

### The ideal candidate will have:

* Good knowledge of Ruby and Rails

* Excellent Javascript skills

* Experience creating accessible web apps

* Mobile development with React Native a plus

### Sound like you?
