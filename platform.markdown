  description: The Dressipi Engine is the core of the platform and has been built
    with scale and computational speed at top of mind. As soon as data enters the
    engine, it begins building models representing customer preferences, behaviour,
    and future buying patterns. At any given time, the Dressipi Engine can process
    hundreds of millions of data points for analysis.

    description: Having worked with leading retailers for a number of years, Dressipi
      understands that any technology you consider needs to be easy to implement and
      demonstrate success quickly, which is why the open Fashion Prediction Platform
      wraps around your existing infrastructure to improve ROI from all platforms.

  - title: Current Platform Integrations
    branch: platform-integrations
    description: "For the first time ever, Dressipi is allowing retailers to connect
      actual customer & visitor profile data with actual garment data (at the feature
      level). \n\nThis will take us from a world of reactive and gut-based retailing
      to a more informed, [data-driven world of predictive retailing](https://dressipi.com/solutions/data-insight/).
      This does not distract from creativity and new trends but allows each retailer
      to better predict how they should respond to key trends, key pieces and how
      they benchmark against their peers."
