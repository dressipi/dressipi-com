  body: Any single retailer only has a 5% view of their customer's wardrobe, making
    it much harder to deliver products and experiences that are relevant to them.
  subsections:
  - title: The Challenge
    list: 'Prediction of customer buying patterns requires a greater understanding
      of each customer’s total shopping and dressing behaviours than the small slice
      typically collected by a single retailer. Furthermore, in-depth data links between
      a products’ attributes and each customer’s preferences and needs are also required.
      It’s only when these data sets are in place, that the power of machine learning
      and AI can get to work on identifying impactful predictions and insights.

'
  - title: The Solution
    list: Dressipi's Universal Network is a comprehensive profile of every customer's
      preferences, activities and purchases across brands, combined with fashion specific
      algorithms and product data to inform each retailer, in real time, what every
