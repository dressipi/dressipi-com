      Dressipi's proprietary garment enrichment data created by real stylists is a world first. Each garment receives up to 35 data points which are checked and validated by an in-house stylist team.

      This industry unique way of labelling and cataloguing product streams gives the retailer a useful, data-driven view of all products attributes. It enables the platform to match the right size and fit of each garment to each customer as well as to create automated outfit suggestions in real-time that are personal to every customer.
