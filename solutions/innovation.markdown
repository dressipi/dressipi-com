    features and styles they love or won’t wear, how confident they are when it comes
    to dressing or shopping, what they want to add to their wardrobe or the events
    and occasions they buy for. \n\nAt Dressipi we believe knowing the answers to
    these questions is the most important opportunity for retailers – it empowers
    better customer experiences, better products and better revenue and profitability. "

  - title: The Dressipi Engine
    body: "The Dressipi Engine is the core of the platform. It has been built with
      scale and computational speed at top of mind. As soon as data enters the engine,
      it begins building models representing customer preferences, behaviour, and
      future buying patterns. \n\nAt any given time, the Dressipi Engine can process
      hundreds of millions of data points for analysis. The more data, the better
      the signal we receive. \n\nOur machine learning technology continuously evaluates
      the performance of our recommendations to select the most effective algorithms
      for every customer at every given time. And, while other providers rely on telling
      customers \"people like you also like this\", Dressipi presents more helpful
      and fashion specific advice such as \"This fit & flare style is a must have
      dress for you and will work well worn with your biker jacket\".\n"
  - title: 'API '
    body: In addition to our base solutions the Dressipi platform has a flexible API
      to feed data and recommendations into existing platforms and solutions, giving
      retailers complete flexibility and differentiation over how they present a fully
      personalised customer experience. Built to accept any data sources and integration
      with future applications such as AR and VR.
