    When shopping for clothing, no one journey is ever the same so why do retailers continue to deliver a one size fits all experience?

    Rather than being purely reactive to customer behaviour, Dressipi gives you the power to predict the most relevant products for each and every customer. Dressipi's machine learning technology continuously evaluates the performance of recommendations to select the most effective algorithms for every customer, considering their individual profile, preferences, behaviour and the context in which they are shopping.

    body: Given the technology that's available today, customers shouldn't all be
      seeing the exact same listing and category pages. Eliminate the hassle of lengthy
      scrolling and hours of searching for the perfect item by showing a personalised
      listing for each customer so they can quickly and easily see the products most
      relevant to them.
