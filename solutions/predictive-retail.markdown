  - title: Product Recommendations
    body: "Recommend your customers the most relevant products in real time based
      on their unique style, preferences and changing needs. \n\nUnlike other personalisation
      solutions every product recommended is mapped to each customer as if curated
      by their own personal stylist. Dressipi does this by analysing a customer’s
      profile, behavioural activity, wardrobe context, trend sentiment and intent.\n"

      delivery of product and outfit recommendations to each individual customer,
      inspiring them to return to store or online. Works with any ESP and can be theme
      based or triggered based on activity.  '
